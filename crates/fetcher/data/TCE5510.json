{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CE5510","description":"The objective of this module is to further equip civil\nengineering students with design knowledge and skills in\nreinforced and prestressed concrete. The module provides\nstudents with fundamental approaches in designing\nstructural concrete components and systems. The students\nwill learn refined methods in the design for action effects\nand for deflection and crack control, and in the structural\ndesign of flat slab systems, slender columns, concrete\nbridges, concrete water tanks, design and detailing of\nconnections. The module is targeted at MSc civil\nengineering students and those with a keen interest on\nadvanced structural concrete design.","title":"Advanced Structural Concrete Design","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"TCE3165","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TCE5510","prereq_tree":"TCE3165","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,1,6]}
