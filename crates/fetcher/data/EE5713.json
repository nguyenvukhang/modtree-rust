{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course will provide a comprehensive overview of modern electrical grids. The topics covered will be useful in planning and operating a modern power system with increasing penetrations of demand side management (DSM) programs, renewable resources and distributed generation. This course will explain how todayâ€™s power systems are evolving to interact with an emerging future with distributed energy resources for peak load management and energy efficiency improvement. Several case studies will be discussed to highlight best practices for design and implementation of these programs to work in conjunction with the changing grid.","title":"Modern Power Systems and Smart Grid","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE5713","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,1,6]}
