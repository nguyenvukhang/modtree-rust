{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module is an introduction to gender and sexuality issues in Singapore from a historical perspective. We examine how our everyday understandings of gender have been formed in a long, complex process of negotiation over the twentieth century. In five themes 1) religion and marriage, 2) non-binary histories, 3) state morality, 4) queer stories and 5) gender troubles, we trace how state and religious authorities have shaped sexual behaviours and gender identities, with varying degrees of conformity and contestation from groups and individuals. Throughout history, gender remained fluid despite multiple attempts at restraining sexuality.","title":"Gender and Sexuality: A Singaporean History","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GESS1037","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,4,3]}
