{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"UTC2717 or UTS27%","description":"Asia, with its populous river basins, poses a global challenge for water resource management. Currently, many of these basins suffer from water scarcity, flood and resource conflicts. In this aspect, Singapore’s impressive progress can offer lessons for water governance. This module will employ a systems perspective to analyse the dynamic linkages between the city-state’s water resource management, its transformation from a third world to a first world country and future risks for sustaining its development. The module will explore pathways for resilience in Singapore’s water sector, draw lessons for Asia and deepen students’ understanding of water governance.","title":"Navigation in Singapore Waters-Bridges and Barriers","department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1918 or GEM1919 or UTC1700 or UTC1701 or UTC1702%","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTS2708","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["GEM1918","GEM1919","UTC1700","UTC1701","UTC1702"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,2,0,8,4]}
