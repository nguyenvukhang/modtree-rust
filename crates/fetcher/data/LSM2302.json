{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Computational thinking is becoming increasingly important across the life sciences, from molecular and cell biology to evolution and ecology. This module will introduce students to computational thinking and will focus on how to solve biological problems using computational approaches. How can you become a computational thinker? How do computers represent and solve problems? How can computers and computational thinking be used to solve problems of relevance to biology? The applied component of the module will teach the basics of programming in R and will focus on biological problems including population growth modelling, epidemic modelling, and analysis of biological data.","title":"Computational Thinking for Life Sciences","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"GCE 'A' Level or H2 Biology or equivalent, or LSM1301 General Biology","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LSM2302","prereq_tree":"LSM1301","fulfill_requirements":["LSM3236"],"workload":[4,0,0,2,4]}
