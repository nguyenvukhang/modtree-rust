{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module introduces different modes of human robot interactions, methods for detecting humans, understanding human behaviors and intentions, and methods for humanrobot coordination and collaboration. Human-robot interactions include physical and non-physical (e.g. social) interactions. Physical interactions include human assistance and wearable robotics. Non-physical interactions include natural language understanding, spoken dialogue, gestures and “body language”, and multimodal interaction fusing different interaction modalities. Human-robot coordination and collaboration include human-robot handovers, robotic assistants and coworkers. User interface design for mutual communications between robot and humans is covered, including social interaction. Several applications and scenarios will be included.","title":"Human-Robot Interaction","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE4705","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.5,0.5,2.0,4.0]}
