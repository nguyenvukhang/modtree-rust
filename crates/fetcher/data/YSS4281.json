{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course covers a range of phenomena within global gendered migrations and carework including types of gendered (im)migration and carework (un/skilled); circular and stepwise migration; peidu Mamas; astronaut, parachute, and kirogi families; care drains; nurse migration; care robots; and distress migration. Via case studies, intersections of how gendered migration regimes impact individual and collective migration and carework experiences will be explored. Sensitized to nested concepts in global affairs, social sciences and migration studies, students will learn to discern around migration infrastructures which care and which do not â€“ seeking solutions to migrant care dilemmas and reconceiving what this means for all.","title":"Gendered Migration and Carework","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSS2202 International Relations or YSS3255 International Development or with the permission of the Instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS4281","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["YSS2202","YSS3255"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,6.5]}
