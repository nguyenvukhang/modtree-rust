This module presents a look, listen, and study of their music and legacy focusing on two parallel movements in the European tradition: the classical, rococo, galante, emfindsamer stil, and neo-classical; and sturm und drang, romantic, and neo-romantic. The focus of learning in this course is through primary source materials. (Non-conservatory students that can read music are invited to enrol in this course as free elective.)","title":"Classical Styles and Romantic Spirits","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MUH2201","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,4,3]}
