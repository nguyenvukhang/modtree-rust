It is structured to contain substantial design and development of hardware and software components. This module is the culminating point of a series of modules integrating the theories which students have already learnt in CS1010, CS2040C, CG2028, CG2271 and CS2113/T. With this capstone project, students would be able to better appreciate the relevance of the various components in the Computer Engineering curriculum to large scale computer engineering projects.","title":"Computer Engineering Capstone Project","department":"Computing and Engineering Programme","faculty":"Multi Disciplinary Programme","prerequisite":"CG2028 Computer Organization and CG2271 Real-Time Operating Systems and CS2113/T Software Engineering & Object-Oriented Programming","module_credit":"8","module_code":"CG4002","prereq_tree":{"and":["CG2028","CG2271",{"and":[],"or":["CS2113","CS2113T"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS5476","CS4276"],"workload":[1,0,3,14,2]}
