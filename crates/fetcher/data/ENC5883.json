{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EN5883","description":"This interdisciplinary course will acquaint students with a range of theoretical approaches to moving images, and equip them to write critically about Southeast Asian screen cultures. The module encourages thinking beyond conventions of cinema studies (national cinema, narrative, genre, etc) â€“ as screen culture spreads far beyond industrial/national cinemas, so should theory and criticism. Readings are drawn from the fields of art and media theory, visual anthropology, and critical and cultural theory, while screenings privilege non-industrial modes like independent film, media art and online video. Emphasis is on the diversification of moving image practices with the uptake of digital media technology.","title":"Screen Culture in Southeast Asia","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate Student in the University or with the approval of the Department","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ENC5883","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[]}
