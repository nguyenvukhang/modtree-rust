{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module provides the foundation for a more advanced level control systems course. Topics include system description, controllability, observability, selection of pole locations for good design, observer design, full-order and reduced-order observers, combined control law and observer. It is also a first course in nonlinear systems and control. Topics include non-linearities in control systems, use of root-locus in analysis of non-linear systems, describing function and its use in analysis and design of control systems, non-linear ordinary differential equations, singular points, and phase-plane analysis.","title":"Advanced Control Systems","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"EE3331C","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE4302","prereq_tree":"EE3331C","fulfill_requirements":["EE5101","ME5401"],"workload":[2.0,1.0,0.5,2.5,4.0]}
