{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module will explore in depth an advanced topic in aesthetics. Possible topics are the ontology of art, the nature of the imagination, the definition of art, subjectivism about beauty, relativism about taste, or the appreciation of nature. Alternatively, we may consider the aesthetics of a particular artform, such as music, film, fiction, painting or dance, or of a particular philosopher, such as Immanuel Kant or Nelson Goodman. Finally, we may consider issues that arise at the intersection of aesthetics and other areas in philosophy, such as the debate over fictionalism in metaphysics.","title":"Issues in Aesthetics","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs, including 28 MCs in PH, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"PH4243","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,9.5]}
