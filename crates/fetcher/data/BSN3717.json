{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"BSP3513, BSP3011","description":"amily firms play an important role in all economies, but especially so in Asia, where large family firms often dominate the private sector. This course allows you to understand family firms from the perspective of the owning family, outside professionals working in family firms, business partners, employees of family offices, investors in family firms and policy makers. The topics include strategy, growth, ownership, innovation, governance, professionalisation, and succession patterns in family firms, as well as an investor and policy perspective. The course is open to students from all NUS faculties and to exchange students interested understanding business in Asia. For students from business families or entrepreneurs building their own firms this course will be particularly relevant as it will provide the knowledge to run and sustain family businesses for generations. For other students, the course will be useful no matter which career you pursue, as you will most likely work with family firms either as your employers, clients, suppliers, or partners.","title":"Family Business","department":"Strategy and Policy","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BSN3717","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,4,3]}
