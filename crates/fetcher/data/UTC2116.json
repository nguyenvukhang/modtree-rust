A university education was traditionally exclusive to the elites but is increasingly seen as crucial to professionalization and social mobility; democratic citizenship; fostering debate and the pursuit of scientific knowledge. This module examines recent debates chronicling how growing trends of neoliberalism have led to changes in how universities and higher education are viewed. We also examine the confluence of historical, political and social factors that shaped the establishment and development of universities in postcolonial society like Singapore. Students will investigate how universities in Singapore relate with their overseas counterparts and with global trends in higher education.","title":"The University Today","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"UTCP usually read a Junior Seminar before they read a Senior Seminar.\nGEM1902% or GEM1912% or UTC11%","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTC2116","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["GEM1902","GEM1912"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,6,4]}
