It allows students the opportunity to pursue, in depth, an advanced project of their own choosing, under the guidance of a faculty supervisor. The Capstone is intended to: \n• give students the opportunity to work independently;\n• encourage students to develop and exhibit aspects of their ability that may not be revealed by course work or a written examination;\n• foster skills and attributes that will be of continuing usefulness in their later career.","title":"Maths, Computational & Statistical Sci Capstone Project","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"All Year 1 and 2 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"10","module_code":"YSC4103","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,6.5]}
