{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course will introduce concepts relevant to the interpretation and statistical analysis of experimental results in the bioengineering field. Theoretical explanations will be followed by hands-on tutorials with relevant computational software. Students will learn how to perform some of the most commonly used statistical analysis of experiments (e.g., z and t tests, ANOVA analysis) as well\nas to interpret the results of typical bioengineering experiments by building a suitably fitted mathematical model.","title":"Bioengineering Data Analysis","department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BN2102","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["EE3801","EE4802","IE2100","IE2130","IE3101","IE4243","IE4211","SPH3101"],"workload":[2,2,0,2,4]}
