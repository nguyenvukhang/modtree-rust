{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CP5105","description":"This module provides an opportunity for students to work on solving problems beyond the formal classroom setting. Through a combination of experiential, self-directed and team learning that spans over two semesters, it aims to develop personal capabilities, professional competencies and translates academic knowledge to industry setting. The full-time 4-months attachment will take place during the second semester. Students should have completed 24MC of graduate-level modules prior to the start of industry internship attachment. Two topical modules from IT5100 series must be taken together with CP5106 prior to internship. Where appropriate, the industrial internship may be replaced by an internal internship with similar rigour that ensures computing development competencies.","title":"Computing Capstone Project (with Internship)","department":"SoC Dean's Office","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"8","module_code":"CP5106","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,12,8]}
