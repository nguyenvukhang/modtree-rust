{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Almost 90% of the infectious diseases related deaths in the world are caused by pneumonia, tuberculosis, diarrhea, malaria, measles and AIDS. When the pathogen (e.g. bacteria or virus) interacts with the host (human or animal), it will divert the function of the host cells for the survival and benefit of the pathogen; causes infection and becomes disease. The major aim of this module is to discuss the causes, prevention, remedies, and economic implications of the common infectious diseases as well as the vectorborne infectious diseases such as Dengue and Zika fever.","title":"Infectious Diseases and Host-Pathogen Interactions","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BL5623","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,1,0,4,4]}
