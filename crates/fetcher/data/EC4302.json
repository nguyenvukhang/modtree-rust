{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module is divided into two sections; long‐ and short‐ run macro‐economic analysis.  In the first section, we shall discuss various theories of economic growth using inter‐temporal optimization models, which include neo‐classical growth models and overlapping‐generations models. In the second section, we shall add stochastic elements to the standard neo‐classical growth model and use it to study business cycles. Our focus will be to highlight the similarities and differences between the Real Business Cycle and New‐Keynesian Models. This course is suitable for students intending to pursue graduate studies or quantitative research (in ministries, statutory boards, etc.) in Economics.","title":"Macroeconomic Analysis III","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs including 28MCs in EC, with a minimum CAP of\n3.20 or be on the Honours track.
