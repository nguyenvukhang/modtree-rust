{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module aims to offer a systematic description of the fundamentals of Intelligent autonomous robotic systems. After the introduction of the typical intelligent systems, the kinematics and dynamics are defined and applied to mobile robotics, helicopters and marine crafts. Their structural and dynamic properties are presented. For autonomy, sensors and sensor fusions are first discussed, followed by path planning, map building, typical control strategies including linear, nonlinear, and neural networks and fuzzy logics, and concluded by on-board hardware implementation. In general, it provides the students a complete understanding of intelligent autonomous robotic system, and facilitates further studies in related areas.","title":"Intelligent Autonomous Robotic Systems","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Preferred with some background on Linear Algebra, Calculus, Classical and Modern Control Theory, and computational skills using matlab, python, C, or C++","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5303","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
