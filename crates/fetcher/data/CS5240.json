{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module lays the theoretical foundation for graduate students to do research in multimedia: images, videos, audio, speech, graphics and text documents. The module covers the main theoretical issues common to various multimedia research.  These issues provide a general framework within which specific techniques in particular research areas can be understood. Topics include: vector and signal representations of multimedia, spatial and frequency analyses, models and parameter estimation methods. Examples will be drawn from different types of media.  Upon completion, students will be well-grounded to pursue further research in computer vision, graphics, natural language processing, audio analysis and multimedia applications.","title":"Theoretical Foundations in MultiMedia","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"((CS1020 or its equivalent) or CS2020 or (CS2040 or its equivalent)) and (MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1508E or MA1513) and \n(MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1507 or (MA1511 and MA1512) or MA1521) and \n(EE2012/A or MA2216 or ST1131/A or ST1232 or ST2131 or ST2334)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS5240","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["CS1020","CS2020","CS2040"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1101R","MA1311","MA1508E","MA1513"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1102R","MA1505","MA1507",{"and":["MA1511","MA1512"],"or":[]},"MA1521"]},{"and":[],"or":["EE2012","EE2012A","MA2216","ST1131","ST1131A","ST1232","ST2131","ST2334"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS6240"],"workload":[3.0,0.0,0.5,3.0,3.0]}
