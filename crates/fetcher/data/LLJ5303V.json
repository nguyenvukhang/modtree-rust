{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This is an interdisciplinary course that invites students to inhabit the field of law and literature by engaging closely with a key topic. Our seminar begins with a broad introduction to the field and related interdisciplinary scholarship, before delving into the focal thematic through close readings of legal and literary texts. This year, we address the question of authorship and its relationship with the law of copyright and intellectual property. Students would become familiar with a constellation of theoretical and historical perspectives from which to rethink our received understandings of authorship, including copyrightâ€™s treatment of books, publishers, and authors.","title":"Law and Literature","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"LLJ5303V","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,9.5]}
