{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Ethnography involves doing fieldwork and writing about it. We examine the tensions between fieldwork, the crafting of the ethnographic text, and its reception within the discipline of anthropology. Following the ‘writing culture' debate, we aim to understand how ethnographers ‘construct' data, frame their analysis, and produce a text. We examine ethnographic ‘realism' as a style, how styles have changed over time, and how differently some researchers have written about the same culture area. The course will heighten students' critical skills and their awareness of how any representation of social reality has been put together.","title":"Reading Ethnographies","department":"Sociology and Anthropology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC or 28 MCs in MS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the\nHonours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"SC4202","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,6.5]}
