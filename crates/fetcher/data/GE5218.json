{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module challenges students to analyse the practical problems encountered in using the various methods available in human geography research. It builds upon the undergraduate modules in research methods and includes an evaluation of the construction and design of research questions in various field contexts, weighing between the major methods of data collection (e.g. quantitative and qualitative), and the practical problems of data and information analysis. Common research methods such as surveys, case studies, interviews, focus group discussions and participant observation will be carried out so that students can benefit from first hand experience in the field. Students will also be exposed to archival and map materials. Students will also be taught what sponsors look for in research proposals. As the module is entirely project-based, students are expected to have full-scale participation in the module.","title":"Research Methods in Human Geography","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GE5218","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
