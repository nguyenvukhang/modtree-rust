{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"What is human nature like, and can knowledge of it tell us how to live? In this module we hone our ability to read, think, and write critically by exploring these questions from the perspectives of philosophy, biology, psychology, and anthropology. We discuss and compare influential historical and contemporary conceptions of human nature and investigate their potential implications for our well-being, social organization, morality, and self-understanding. We thus critically reflect on (i) how such conceptions underly public policy, moral norms, and scientific inquiry, and (ii) how our own conception of human nature shapes our beliefs and lived experience.","title":"Human Nature","department":"NUS College","faculty":"NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NTW2033","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,0,0,3,3]}
