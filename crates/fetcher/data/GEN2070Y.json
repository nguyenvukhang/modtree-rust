{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"ComLink is a nationwide initiative to befriend disadvantaged families with young children by providing comprehensive support that would help propel them towards realizing their own aspirations. In this module, students will learn key concepts in volunteerism, and essential skills, including communications, collaboration, conflict management, and family befriending. They will then apply these skills as ComLink Befrienders through regular home visitations, needs assessment, and connecting the families with community resources, journeying with them towards stability, self-reliance and social mobility. Students will thus develop character, empathy, and personal effectiveness.","title":"Community Link (ComLink) Befrienders","department":"Office of Sr Dy Pres and Provost","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GEN2070Y","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,2,0,4,3]}
