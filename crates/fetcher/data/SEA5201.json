{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GE5215","description":"This module will examine the complexities of environmental issues in Southeast Asia. There is a need to unpack what really lies behind all sides of environmental problems. A political ecology approach will be used to examine the multiple layers of politics, money, power and neglect that lie behind these issues. We will travel across Southeast Asia, dive deep into its rich biodiversity and explore the extent of the environmental threats the region faces, as well as the plight of the people whose identity, lives and livelihoods depend wholly on the health of these highly endangered ecosystems.","title":"Politics of Environment in Southeast Asia","department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SEA5201","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,1,6]}
