The course is highly collaborative and cultivates a supportive ensemble. Students take healthy emotional risks that foster personal growth. The work is grounded by basic Stanislavski scene work, augmented by an introduction to Viewpoints. Students perform two modern scenes, an audition monologue, and original short pieces. Rehearsal is required outside studio time.
