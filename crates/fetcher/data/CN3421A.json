{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces model formulation and MATLAB programming specially for chemical engineering students. This course covers the formulation of process models and necessary numerical techniques for solving the model equations arising in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, reaction engineering, transport phenomena, and process systems engineering. The numerical techniques include methods for solving systems of linear and non-linear algebraic equations and systems of linear and non-linear ordinary and partial differential equations. Direct and iterative techniques, numerical differentiation and integration, linear regression, error propagation, convergence and stability analysis will also be taught in the context of chemical engineering problems. Students will learn using various tools (Excel spreadsheet and MATLAB) for solving different numerical problems. This module is targeted at level 3 chemical and environmental engineering students.","title":"Process Modeling And Numerical Simulation","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"MA1511: Engineering Calculus\nMA1512: Differential Equations for Engineering\nMA1513: Linear Algebra with Differential Equations","module_credit":"3","module_code":"CN3421A","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["MA1511","MA1512","MA1513"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.5]}
