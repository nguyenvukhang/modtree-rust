Since the rise of a Hindu party in Indian politics, public discourse has expanded and homegrown ideas in their religious, economic, and political forms, have re-emerged. We will read some of these texts and understand the key ideological divides in the country. These ideologies have real effects. They influence the state’s role in faith, the managing of diversity, the fixity of a constitution, and more. They are central to the country’s economic, political and social direction. By the end of the course, we will understand how to study ideology, locate it in diverse forms, and develop skills towards interpretation.","title":"Ideology in India","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSS1206 Introduction to Comparative Politics or YSS3302 Colonialism and Decolonization or a course related to Politics in India or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS4273","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["YSS1206","YSS3302"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,5.5,4.0]}
