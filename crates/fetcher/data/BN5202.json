{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The objective of this course is to provide an understanding of the engineering-based problems encountered in orthopaedic practice. It will cover the structure and function of the musculoskeletal tissues (such as bone, cartilage, ligament) that will introduce the forces and moments acting on the musculoskeletal system, and the concepts of tissue regeneration and repair. The course will also look at the biomechanics of joints of the body and the use of orthopaedic implants for reconstruction and repair of articular joints. Finally, the student is introduced to limb amputation surgery and the prosthetic limb replacement from an engineering perspective.","title":"Orthopaedic Biomechanics","department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BN5202","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
