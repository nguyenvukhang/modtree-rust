{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CS6283","description":"This module covers theoretical foundations of trustworthy machine learning. It covers tools for the analysis of privacy, robustness, and fairness in machine learning using techniques from statistics, probability, and machine learning. Some questions considered include Can we trust machine learning frameworks to access sensitive personal data? Can we trust algorithms to learn robust decision rules in the presence of adversarial and noisy data? Can we build algorithms that provide fair predictions and avoid discrimination? Can we make machine learning models more verifiable, interpretable, ethical, and accountable? The module provides an algorithmic approach towards defining and achieving trustworthy machine learning.","title":"Trustworthy Machine Learning","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"Students should have a strong background in machine learning algorithms, and probability. \nThe major pre-requisite modules are:\n➢ CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms\n➢ Probability: (EE2012/A or MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)\n➢ CS3244 Machine Learning","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS5562","prereq_tree":"CS3230","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,0,2]}
