Electromagnetics is essential in all\ndisciplines of electrical engineering. At the end of this\nmodule, students will be able to explain many physical\nphenomena in everyday life, such as electricity energy\ntransmission, wave reflection/transmission, and the impact\nof skin depth on wave propagation. Topics covered\ninclude: static electric fields, static magnetic fields, timevarying\nfields, electromagnetic waves, transmission lines\nand antennas.","title":"Electromagnetics for Electrical Engineers","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA1511 and MA1512","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC2020","prereq_tree":{"and":["MA1511","MA1512"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["EE4101","EE4112","EE5801","PC3247","PC3267","PC3232B","PC3295"],"workload":[3,1,2,0,4]}
