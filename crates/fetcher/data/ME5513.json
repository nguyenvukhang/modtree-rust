{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"OT5208 Fatigue and Fracture for Offshore Structures\nME5513A Fatigue Analysis for Additive Manufacturing","description":"The objective is to expose students to the various engineering methods to tackle practical problems related to deformation, fracture and fatigue of materials so that they can apply them to real situations. Major topics include: Complex and principle states of stress and strain, yielding and fracture under combined stresses, linear elastic fracture mechanics, standard tests for fracture toughness; fatigue analysis and testing, factors affecting fatigue properties of materials, fatigue crack propagation, fracture and fatigue mechanisms and control, statistical vairaion of mechanical properties. This module is useful for students interested on materials failure analysis and/or materials design and applications.","title":"Deformation, Fracture and Fatigue of Materials","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME5513","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[]}
