{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course studies women, gender, and sexuality in early America. From 1500 to 1820, European colonialism and the growth of chattel slavery disrupted customary Native American, European, and African gender roles. Major social, cultural, and economic changes turned America into a space characterized by religious, ethnic, and racial diversity. As active participants or unwilling captives, women from a variety of backgrounds helped to forge these new societies. They disguised themselves as sailors and soldiers, resisted enslavement, and fostered new spiritual movements. Some transgressed customary gender roles and challenged sexual norms, while others benefited from emerging systems of inequality.","title":"Nasty Girls: Gender, Sexuality & Race in Early America","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"All Year 1 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3295","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,2.5,7.0]}
