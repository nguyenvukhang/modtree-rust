{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"TE2101/TEE2101 Programming Methodology TIC1001 Introduction to Computing and Programming I","description":"This modules introduces fundamental programming methodologies for solving real-life complex problem using Python with emphasis in industrial operations and supply chains management oriented applications. Topics include problem solving by computing, writing pseudo-codes, problem formulation and problem solving, program development, coding, testing and debugging, fundamental programming constructs (variables, types, expressions, assignments, functions, control structures, etc.), fundamental data structures: arrays, strings and structures, data processing using large scale data sets from files, visualization, facilitating a design towards solving complex problems. Module will expose both Python and one or more of its variants used for scientific computations such as SciPy and NumPy.","title":"Programming Methodology with Python","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TIE2030","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,1,0,5]}
