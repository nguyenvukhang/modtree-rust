{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces students to the science and practice of forest landscape restoration (FLR). As a field of inquiry and a body of practice, FLR aims to enhance ecological functionality and human well-being across degraded or deforested forest landscapes. Through classroom inquiry, field investigation, and analysis of data from restoration projects, students in this module explore how the ecological restoration of forest and tree cover in tropical landscapes (urban and rural) can maintain, improve, or restore biodiversity and vital ecological functions. Students also investigate the role of scientific research for evaluating existing FLR strategies and developing new ones.","title":"Forest Restoration","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC2247 Ecology and Ecosystems or YSC3251 Conservation Ecology or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YID3225","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["YSC2247","YSC3251"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,6.5]}
