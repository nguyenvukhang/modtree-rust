{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"Students admitted into the Pharmaceutical Science programmes.","description":"Blended learning is the way of instruction for this 6-week module. Students learn to recognize, assess, prevent and therapeutically manage conditions affecting the human immune and endocrine systems. Applied therapeutics and pharmacology provide the knowledge for clinical reasoning. The scientific topics include cellular and humoral components of the immune system; impact of physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties on the biologics’ ADME profile; biotechnological techniques employed for biologics manufacture; immune mediated toxicity and risk; differentiation of proprietary products and their biosimilars. Pharmacist’s value in a collaborative care team is discussed. The socio-economic impact on the use of therapeutic biologics is studied.","title":"Immune & Endocrine Systems: Science & Therapeutics","department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PR1153 Pharmacy Foundations: Science & Therapeutics II\nAND\nPR2156 Integumentary & Ocular Systems: Science & Therapeutics","module_credit":"6","module_code":"PR3152","prereq_tree":{"and":["PR1153","PR2156"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,3,0,1,7]}
