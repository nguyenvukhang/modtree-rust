{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CM1111 Inorganic Chemistry 1, CM2111 Inorganic Chemistry 2","description":"There would be two parts to the lectures of the module (i) basic theories and concepts and (ii) chemistry and physical properties of main group elements and selected transition metals. Included in part (i) are qualitative molecular orbital theory, acid-base theories and redox chemistry. Part (ii) is a survey of main group elements including selected transition metals. Emphasis is placed on trends and periodicity. Exemplary compounds of elements are important in understanding bonding and reactivities, and chemical processes and reactions are of technological/industrial/environmental/biological importance. There is a practical component which consists of synthetic experiments.","title":"Chemistry of Elements","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM1102 Chemistry â€“ The Central Science","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CM2112","prereq_tree":"CM1102","fulfill_requirements":["CM3111","CM3191"],"workload":[4,1,1,0,4]}
