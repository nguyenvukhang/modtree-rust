{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"Cohort AY2020/2021 and earlier","description":"This is a first course in analytical chemistry and shall introduce to students a toolkit for performing a chemical analysis in the 21st century. This toolkit consists of sampling methods; sample treatment and preparation; statistics; data treatment and several ubiquitously-used analytical techniques. These include principles and applications of separation science with a focus on gas and liquid chromatography, electrochemistry (voltammetry, coloumetry, potentiometry), gravimetry, titrimetry and elemental analysis. Lectures will be complemented by practical sessions to give the students a good grounding in the basics of chemical analysis.","title":"Basic Toolkit of Analytical Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM1102 Chemistry â€“ The Central Science","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CM2143","prereq_tree":"CM1102","fulfill_requirements":["CM3141","CM3192"],"workload":[1.5,0.0,1.5,0.0,7.0]}
