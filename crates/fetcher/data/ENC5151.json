The module introduces some foundational material on the history and cultures of Empire, and introduces texts from the greater Anglophone world, asking how these fictional works illuminate the forces that shape the globalized yet unequal world we currently inhabit. Critical contexts include those of race, aboriginality, gender, political economy, migration, cosmopolitanism, technology, and war.","title":"Global Anglophone Literature","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ENC5151","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,3,7]}
