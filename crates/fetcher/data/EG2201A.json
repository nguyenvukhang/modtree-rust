{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This is a design module which focuses on user needs, bringing together their perspectives along with those of various stakeholders, to deliver solutions in a collaborative manner. The key element in this module is the process that students go through to frame design problems, define a hypothesis for testing, and to build low fidelity prototypes for feedback and validation. Through an open-ended team project, students work collaboratively in a studio environment to create a shared understanding of the problem statement. Students go on to develop concept solutions which can be prototyped and tested.","title":"User-Centred Collaborative Design","department":"CDE Dean's Office","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EG2201A","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2.5,0.0,4.0,3.5,0.0]}
