{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Metaphors are everywhere in plays and poetry. Romeo says that Juliet is the sun and Kālidāsa describes beautiful eyes as lotuses. But we can find metaphors in ordinary speech, too, when we say strictly false things like “The ATM ate my card.” But what makes a linguistic utterance a metaphor? How do they work? Do they mean anything other than something literally false? What could such a meaning be? And if they don’t communicate other meanings, what are they doing? This course considers theories of metaphor from within three major philosophical traditions India, China, and the broadly analytic tradition.","title":"Global Philosophy of Metaphor","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3372","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
