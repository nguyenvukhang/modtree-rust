{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This advanced seminar will survey Hannah Arendt’s political thought, from Origins of Totalitarianism (1951) to the Life of the Mind (1978). Particular emphasis will be given to Arendt’s 1) understanding of the Western tradition of political philosophy, since its origins in Plato, as a necessarily failed attempt to subordinate practice to theory, and thus politics to philosophy; 2) the highly original conceptions of politics and philosophy underlying her view; and 3) the promising and influential yet inconclusive theory of judgment to which it has led. Reading will include both primary and secondary sources.","title":"The Political Theory of Hannah Arendt","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Four courses in either PPE or Philosophy, or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS4276","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
