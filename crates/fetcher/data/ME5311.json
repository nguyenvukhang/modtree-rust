{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module covers basic linear algebra principles to provide the formalism to reveal coherent patterns and behaviors in data. We will introduce system identification methods, dimensionality reduction techniques, dynamical system theory, inverse problems in their Bayiesian form and machine learning techniques, with a special focus on neural networks. These will provide students with the necessary tools to analyze real-world datasets that are commonly found in practical engineering and scientific applications.","title":"Data-Driven Engineering and Machine Learning","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"B.Eng.
