{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"In this module we will examine how communities of microorganisms (microbiomes) are critical to the healthy function of the Earth system at various scales. The critical role of environmental microbiomes in biogeochemical transformations that underpin biosphere function will be considered, along with the consequences of disturbance due to climate change and pollution. The application of microbiomes to solving environmental problems will be discussed with reference to waste treatment and carbon capture. We will also interrogate the role of microbiomes in the health of animal and plant populations, their interactions with the environment, and the significance to adaptation and evolution. Finally, we will examine the human microbiome and how it is impacted by environmental exposures, and the consequences for our health and behaviour.","title":"Microbiomes","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC2236","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,1,1]}
