{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EE3103E, EE3131E","description":"This module introduces the fundamentals of analog and digital communications. It starts with an overview of modern communication systems based on analog and digital techniques and an elaboration on the advantages of digital over analog systems. Then, the basic analog communication techniques are introduced, including amplitude/frequency modulation and demodulation. This is followed by an introduction of analog-to-digital conversion techniques, including signal sampling and quantization theory. Finally, it introduces the three main building blocks of digital communication systems, including source coding, channel coding, and digital modulation/demodulation.","title":"Communication Systems","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"TEE2023","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TEE3131","prereq_tree":"TEE2023","fulfill_requirements":["TEE4113"],"workload":[2,1,0,0,7]}
