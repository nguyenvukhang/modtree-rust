{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"IS2102","description":"This module aims to equip non-computing students with fundamental knowledge in architecting and designing modern Enterprise Systems in organisations that can be reasonably complex, scalable, distributed, component-based and missioncritical. Students will develop an understanding of high-level concepts such as enterprise architecture and software architecture. They will them move on to acquire fundamental systems analysis and design techniques such as object-oriented requirements analysis and design using the Unified Modelling Language.","title":"Enterprise Systems Architecture Fundamentals","department":"Information Systems and Analytics","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"IT5004","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
