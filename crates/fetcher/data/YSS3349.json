{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"What is an empire? What is a nation? How do these interact in moments of crisis like decolonization? This course will examine how spatial boundaries and social boundaries interact as empires expand, both over land and overseas, and as empires contract. Our central focus will be how the “nation” works as a contested notion, and a contested boundary, within the broader frame of empire. We will trace struggles over national identities as metropolitan cores and colonial peripheries have been produced in the Americas (including the Caribbean), Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa.","title":"Empire, Nation, and Decolonization","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS3349","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,9.5]}
