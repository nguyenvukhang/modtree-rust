{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"YSC2204 Fundamentals of Programming","description":"We cover basic data structures and algorithms with an emphasis on implementation, although theory (asymptotic analysis, including amortization) is also covered.  Topics include lists, queues, stacks, union-find, binary heaps, red-black trees, hashtables, tries, binary search, efficient quicksort, graph representations, depth-first and breadth-first search, topological sort, Dijkstra’s, Prim’s and Kruskal’s, Huffman coding, and Knuth-Morris-Pratt.  Additional topics may include:\n•\tRandomization (e.g. Bloom filters, Miller-Rabin, Rabin-Karp)\n•\tTime-space tradeoffs (e.g. range queries)\n•\tParallel considerations (e.g. Map/Reduce, prefix-sum, quicksort)\n•\tPurely functional data structures (e.g. of red-black trees)\n•\tApproximation algorithms (e.g. vertex covering)\n•\tMore sophisticated data structures and algorithms (e.g. leftist heaps, binomial \n        heaps, splay trees).","title":"Introductory Data Structures and Algorithms","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science or with the permission of the\ninstructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC2229","prereq_tree":"YSC1212","fulfill_requirements":["YSC3203","YSC4230","YSC4231","YSC4233"],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
