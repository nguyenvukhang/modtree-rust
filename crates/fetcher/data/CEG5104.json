{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module covers the fundamental ideas behind the design and operation of cellular networks. The module provides students with an understanding of the\nfundamental principles and concepts encountered in cellular networks. In particular, students will learn about the cellular network design process, radio channel modelling, network dimensioning and capacity planning, mobility,\nhandoffs, and security. Practical standards such as GSM, IS-95, 3G, 4G and 5G will be used as illustration examples. On completion of the module, students should be able to understand the design process and operation of cellular networks, as well as the factors affecting their performance and deployment.","title":"Cellular Networks","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5104","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,1,6]}
