{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The computational complexity of many modern day applications such as machine learning necessitates exploiting the parallelism and acceleration provided by hardware. This can lead to a much higher throughput and much lower power requirements as compared to traditional CPUs. This module will cover the design of systems which use GPUs and reconfigurable platforms (FPGAs) for acceleration of computations. Various tools and platforms for programming GPUs and FPGAs, as well as techniques for efficient mapping of algorithms to architectures will be examined.","title":"Hardware Acceleration and Reconfigurable Computing","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Knowledge of microcontroller programming and Interfacing / Computer Organisation / Equivalent in undergraduate studies.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5203","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,2,2,4]}
