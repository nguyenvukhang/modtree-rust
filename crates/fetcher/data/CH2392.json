{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CH2244","description":"According to conventional wisdom, Chinese women in history were particularly oppressed. It was only\nin the modern period that the patriarchal system started to break down and gender equality was finally\nrealized. Such a simplistic view of dividing Chinese women’s experiences into two mutually exclusive\ncategories of “traditional” and “modern” is misleading. This course sets out to provide a more complex\nand nuanced picture of the life of Chinese women over time in China and elsewhere. Topics cover\ninclude marriage, women’s education, works and property rights, ideas about the female body and\nchastity and so on.","title":"Chinese Women in Context (in English)","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CH2392","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
