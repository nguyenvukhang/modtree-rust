{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Writing Hybrid is an intermediate writing module that explores the tradition and practice of writing in between and across the genres. Building upon the skills from the introductory writing courses, it explores the ways in which hybrid texts expose the tensions and limits of conventional genres (poetry, fiction, nonfiction) and propose alternative forms of writing practices. It investigates, in particular, the ways hybrid writing (lyric essays, prose poems, text +image, etc) are able to embody postcolonial identities, queer/ minority / liminal subjectivities, which resist traditional forms and genres. Students will undergo seminars, writing workshops leading toward a final creative portfolio.","title":"Writing Hybrid","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"It is preferred but not required that the student has already taken YHU2292 Introduction to Poetry Writing, YHU2293 Introduction to Fiction Writing, or YHU2202 Introduction to Creative Nonfiction.
