{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"In this module, we will take on an interdisciplinary lens in understanding the needs, strengths and challenges of youths and youths-at-risk in Singapore, as well as the ecosystems they are embedded in. Specifically, using the positive youth development approach, we will discuss how environmental and intrapersonal strengths can improve positive outcomes for these youths. We will also explore topics such as youth culture, youth mental health, risk and resilience in youth, youth voice and activism, among others. Importantly, we will examine how our deepened understanding of youths can inform our meaningful engagement with them.","title":"Positive Youth Development in Singapore","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"UTC11%, UTC14%, UTC17% (UTCP Junior Seminar)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTC2416","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,6,4]}
