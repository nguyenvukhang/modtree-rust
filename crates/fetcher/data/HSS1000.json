{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This foundation module introduces interdisciplinary work in contemporary social science and encourages thinking about social complexity. We will examine how social scientists construct causal theories, collect and interpret evidence, and use findings to inform knowledge and practice. We will consider pertinent issues affecting contemporary societies, especially those current in Singapore society. Through comparisons of Singapore with other cases in Asia and beyond, students will gain the ability to analyse critically the context-dependent nature of human behaviour and social change. The module will help students grapple with difficult social questions of our times and see possibilities for the future of society.","title":"Understanding Social Complexity","department":"FASS DO/Office of Programmes","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HSS1000","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,0,7]}
