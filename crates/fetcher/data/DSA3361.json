{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Data analytics refers to the process of examining data sets to extract the information they contain. It may be of interest to understand how one set of “output” variables in the data set depends on another set of “input” variables. This module introduces students to commonly used techniques in inferential analytics. Topics include parameter estimation, assessing the precision of estimates, linear regression (model building, interpretation and diagnosis), resampling methods, logistic regression, trade-off between interpretability and prediction, connection to prescriptive analytics. Students will gain practical experience applying these techniques to realworld data.","title":"Inferential Data Analytics","department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"{GEA1000 Quantitative Reasoning with Data or GER1000 Quantitative Reasoning or DSA1101 Introduction to Data Science or DSE1101 Introductory Data Science for Economics or ST1131 Introduction to Statistics and Statistical Computing} and MA2401 Introductory Mathematics with R\n\nMA2401 may be replaced by three modules as follows:\n- One module from MA1101R, MA1311, MA1508E, MA1513, or MA2001; and\n- One module from MA1102R, MA1312, MA1505, MA1507, MA1511, MA1521, or MA2002; and\n- One module from MA2216/MA2116/ST2131 or ST2334","module_credit":"4","module_code":"DSA3361","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["GEA1000","GER1000","DSA1101","DSE1101","ST1131"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA2401","MA1101R","MA1311","MA1508E","MA1513","MA2001"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1102R","MA1312","MA1505","MA1507","MA1511","MA1521","MA2002"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA2216","MA2116","ST2131","ST2334"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["DSA3362"],"workload":[2,1,1,3,3]}
