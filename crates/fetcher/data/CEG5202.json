{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module aims to present the required foundations of embedded software systems and security aspects. Students will learn how an embedded system and its software components interact and work using a structured data flow methodology. Security aspects and ways to mitigate certain attacks will be introduced. Module covers design of algorithms for embedded RT schedulers and firmware. Case studies on certain embedded are presented to give students a better understanding of the subject. Students can attempt to realize of a machine learning algorithm on small-scale IoT and other hardware platforms or on an emulator.","title":"Embedded Software Systems and Security","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Software implementation skills using matlab, python, C, or C++, Verilog/VHDL programming knowledge is mandatory, if the project chosen is on FPGA hardware.\nBasic knowledge on CPU workings using any assembly language is an added asset.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5202","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
