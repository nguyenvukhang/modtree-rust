{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module starts with a brief introduction on semiconductors, ionic conductors and mixed conductors. Various transport measurements, with an emphasis on impedance studies, will be introduced. After a brief discussion of methods for the synthesis and characterization of nanomaterials, the importance of nanomaterials in the context of thermodynamics, electrical conduction and thermal conduction will be highlighed. Various energy systems (solar cells, fuel cells, thermoelectrics, batteries, and supercapacitors) using nanomaterials focusing on energy conversion and storage will be covered. Course will end with remarks on the engineering aspects such as safety issues and development of miniaturised energy devices using nanomaterials.","title":"Nanomaterials for Energy Engineering","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Level 3 Standing","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME4252","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,0,6]}
