{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Resource conservation and waste minimization are some of the greatest current concerns for chemical process industries. With impending resource depletion and climate change issues, it is imperative for process industries to transform and adapt to a more efficient and sustainable operating mode. In this module, the concepts of circular economy, and the implementation of waste-to-energy and waste-to-chemicals technologies will be evaluated. The versatile and useful techniques of process integration and resource conservation networks (RCNs) will also be \nintroduced to prepare students in process design or retrofitting projects with waste minimization as an objective.","title":"Circular Economy in the Chemical Industry","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN5203","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,2,5]}
