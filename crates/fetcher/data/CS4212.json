{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The objective of this module is to introduce the principal ideas behind program compilation, and discusses various techniques for program parsing, program analysis, program optimisation, and run-time organisation required for program execution. Topics covered include regular expressions, context-free grammars, lexical analysis, syntax analysis; different algorithms for parsing codes, such as top-down parsing, bottom-up parsing; translation to abstract syntax using modern parser generator technology, intermediate representation, semantics analysis, type system, un-optimised code generation, code optimisation, data-flow analysis, instruction scheduling.","title":"Compiler Design","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS2104 Programming Language","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS4212","prereq_tree":"CS2104","fulfill_requirements":["CS5218","CS5271","CS6202","CS6215"],"workload":[2,1,0,3,3]}
