{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"YHU2288 Queer Fictions","description":"Moving away from the model of friendship established in the writings of Aristotle, Montaigne to Bacon, whereby only men are considered capable of true friendship, Morrison’s question—“What is friendship between women when unmediated by men?”—motivates a study on women’s bonds to women, including affiliations that are chosen and beyond choice, competitive and cordial, sisterly and extra-familial. Rather than a course on homo-erotics, this is a study on the ethics of care and relationality. Friendship is studied as a critical conception for women’s emancipation, an ontological foundation on which connections are (re-)built, and a mode of relational self-definition.","title":"Girlfriends: Narratives of Friendship","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 1; or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU2311","prereq_tree":{"and":["YCC1111","YCC1112"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
