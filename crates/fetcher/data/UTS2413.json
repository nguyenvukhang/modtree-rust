{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"While globalisation has generally improved local communities in Singapore and elsewhere, how and why has it also led to greater challenges and even crises, many of which harm communities and undermine globalisation itself? By taking a people-centered analysis, this seminar critically examines how global issues – ranging from pandemics to migration to social media – impact local communities. Rather than treating communities as passive, this interdisciplinary module draws on studies from systems approaches to sociology to demonstrate how communities exercise power in responding to globalisation. Using Singapore as a reference point, the seminar explores debates on globalisation and strengthening communities.","title":"Think Global, Act Local Understanding Global Singapore","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTS2413","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
