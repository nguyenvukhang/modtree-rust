{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"How does our perception of space influence how we experience, interact with and value different places? This module adopts an interdisciplinary approach to consider the way that places themselves can reinforce ecological, historical, economic, political and other constructs, and how these in turn influence the way we relate to and ascribe meanings to places. Through analysis of case studies, field trips and digital tools, students will evaluate the contestations and shifting identities that arise when places undergo change and development in Singapore, and propose possibilities for the preservation, adaptation or transformation of a place of their choice.","title":"Exploring Sense of Place","department":"Ridge View Residential College","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"RVSS1000","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
