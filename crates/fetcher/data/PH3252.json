{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course investigates some of the deep and puzzling philosophical issues arising from mathematics. Some are metaphysical and semantic: What is mathematics about? Are there such things as mathematical objects (numbers, functions, sets, etc), and if so, do they exist in the same way as more familiar entities such as tables and chairs? Others are epistemological: How do we obtain mathematical knowledge? Does it arise from pure reason alone, or does the empirical world play a role? In the course of addressing such questions, we will examine a number of influential views, including logicism, constructivism, platonism, fictionalism, and structuralism.","title":"Introduction to Philosophy of Mathematics","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"GEM2006 Logic or GET1028 Logic","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PH3252","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["GEM2006","GET1028"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,0,7]}
