{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CN2122","description":"This module considers the classification of fluids and their properties, followed by the analysis of static fluid. The integral and differential forms of the fundamental equations â€“ Continuity, Momentum\nand Energy equations are then studied. The concept of momentum transfer by the shear stress is\nintroduced in this course. Dimensional analysis and model theory are studied. The concept about\nboundary layer theory, flow with pressure gradient, viscous flow and turbulence are also described.\nPractical aspect involves the consideration of flows in closed conduits. At the end of the course,\nbasic concepts regarding fluid machinery is also covered.","title":"Fluid Mechanics","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"H2 Physics\nMA1511: Engineering Calculus\nMA1512: Differential Equations for Engineering","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN2122A","prereq_tree":"MA1512","fulfill_requirements":["CN3135","CN3101A"],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
