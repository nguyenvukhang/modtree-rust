It covers the basic principles and practice for collecting data and extracting useful insights, illustrated in a variety of application domains. For example, when two issues are correlated (e.g., smoking and cancer), how can we tell whether the relationship is causal (e.g., smoking causes cancer)? How can we deal with categorical data? Numerical data? What about uncertainty and complex relationships? These and many other questions will be addressed using data software and computational tools, with real-world data sets.","title":"Quantitative Reasoning with Data","department":"Office of Sr Dy Pres and Provost","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GEA1000","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["DSA2101","DSA3361"],"workload":[2.5,1.5,0.0,3.0,3.0]}
