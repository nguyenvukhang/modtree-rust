{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This elective module assumes knowledge of and is a sequel to PC2032. A good command of calculus and linear algebra is desirable. It is intended for students who wish to acquire a deeper understanding of our Mechanical Universe. It considers the principles of relativistic, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics, and aims to establish a bridge to the principles of modern Physics. Topics covered include: dynamics with central forces, bound and unbound orbits, scattering; relativistic kinematics and dynamics of a particle, Lorentz transformations, four-dimensional notations; Lagrangian mechanics, the action principle, Euler-Lagrange equation; Hamiltonian mechanics.","title":"Classical Mechanics II","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(PC2032 or PC2132) and PC2174A or departmental approval","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC3261","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["PC2032","PC2132"]},"PC2174A"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
