{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"QF4102/QF4102A Financial Modelling and Computation\nQF5209A Financial Derivatives: Modelling and Computation","description":"This module aims to present students with the knowledge of modelling financial processes essential for the pricing and hedging of financial derivatives. The modelling of financial derivatives such as vanilla options, barrier options, lookback options and Asian options will be covered. The emphasis of the module will be on the use of various numerical methods commonly used for various pricing applications of financial derivatives. Numerical methods covered include binomial tree methods, finite difference methods and Monte-Carlo simulation methods. Assignments will involve the implementation of numerical methods for pricing derivatives, and the preparation of reports presenting the numerical results. This module targets students in the Master in Quantitative Finance programme.","title":"Financial Derivatives: Modelling and Computation","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"QF5209","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
