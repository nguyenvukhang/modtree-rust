{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Many morphosyntactic phenomena, such as those concerning subject-verb agreement or wh-dependencies, are typically seen as reflecting abstract grammatical rules. However, linguists have often questioned the need for such rules, arguing that these phenomena can be more fruitfully understood as the product of sentence processing and cognitive constraints, such as the limits of working memory. This module introduces students to these perspectives, their underlying assumptions, and their successes and limitations. Through this module, students will also become more familiar with the logic of linguistics experiments and statistical analysis.","title":"Grammar and Language Processing","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including (i) 28 MCs in EL, and (ii) \nEL2101 or with instructor's consent, with a minimum \nCAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"EL4880F","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,5.5]}
