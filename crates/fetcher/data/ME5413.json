{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This modules introduces the techniques used in robotics for autonomous navigation of mobile robots. It gives a basic knowledge of kinematic configurations of mobile, wheeled, robots and focuses on the algorithms for trajectory planning and for trajectory following. They include mapping and localization techniques, as well as obstacle avoidance techniques, in path planning and reactive obstacle avoidance, which involve the use of sensors onboard the robot. Case studies will be analysed with special attention to self-driving cars.","title":"Autonomous Mobile Robotics","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME5413","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2.0,1.5,0.0,1.5,5.0]}
