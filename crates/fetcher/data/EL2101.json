{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EL2201","description":"This course explores language structure, in particular, patterns of sentence structure (syntax) and of meaning (semantics), from a cross-linguistic perspective. Concepts to be discussed include grammatical categories, semantic relations, grammatical relations, constituency, and the relationship between grammar and the lexicon. A key feature of the module is its emphasis on the evidence and argumentation that bears upon the representation of structure and principles of grammar that we postulate. The course provides the foundation for the study of advanced courses investigating linguistic structure.","title":"Structure of Sentences and Meanings","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EL1101E or GEK1011","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EL2101","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["EL1101E","GEK1011"]},"fulfill_requirements":["EL3201","EL3205","EL3213"],"workload":[0,0,0,3,7]}
