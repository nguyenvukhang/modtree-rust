{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module covers machine learning models beyond the introductory level and provides depth in machine learning for industrial engineering (IE) applications. The module contains three parts. The first part introduces machine learning models such as supervised/unsupervised learning, decision tree, neural networks, and reinforcement learning. The second part discusses optimization techniques for machine learning and IE, such as (stochastic) gradient descent, power method, EM algorithm, and the reformulations of models into linear/nonlinear programming. In the third part, students will study and solve IE applications using their machine learning knowledge. Moreover, the module also exposes students to open-source/commercial software in the industry.","title":"Machine Learning for Industrial Engineering","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"IE3101","module_credit":"4","module_code":"IE4215","prereq_tree":"IE3101","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
