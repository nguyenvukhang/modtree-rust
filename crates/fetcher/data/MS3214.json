This module will critically approach tradition as encompassing the plural “Asian traditions” and the notion of modernisation or modernity, as they relate to transformational experiences of nation-making, identity-formation and self and communal actualization. Debates and critiques on Asian traditions and modernity are examined in relation to nation, gender, intellectualism, spirituality, heritage, visual arts, architecture and aesthetics in the Malay world in comparison to other Asian and global experiences.","title":"Asian Traditions and Modernisation","department":"Malay Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MS3214","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
