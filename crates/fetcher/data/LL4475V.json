{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"There is minimal overlap with the other existing modules. The main takeaway is that this new module is very much focused on the regulatory issues that arise in the day-to-day activity of investment management. It is structured from the perspective of someone engaged in advising on regulatory compliance issues faced by an investment manager. As such, the coverage is quite wide, but it will not go into the same depth on some of the topics covered by the other more narrowly focused electives. It is meant to lay a good groundwork for those seeking to pursue a career in this field, with a focus not only on the law but also the practice of investment management in navigating the regulatory environment. The module also covers many topics not covered by the existing modules.","description":"This course focuses on the law, directives and guidelines pertaining to the conduct of investment management activity in Singapore.
