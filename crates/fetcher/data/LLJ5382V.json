This course offers students a comprehensive overview of the foundations of private international law, with a particular focus on Singapore law. It covers private international law’s three main pillars - jurisdiction, choice of law and foreign judgments - and also touches on broader methodological issues, and questions of sovereignty, comity, and public policy, which undergird and define the boundaries of the field.","title":"Private International Law","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"LLJ5382V","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[]}
