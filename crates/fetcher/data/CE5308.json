{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module consists of two parts related to coastal processes and sediment transport. The first part covers some basics of nearshore hydrodynamics, including wave shoaling, wave refraction, and surf zone processes. Also, the interaction between aquatic plants and waves will be introduced.\n\nThe second part of the module will introduce coastal sediment transport, including basic concepts, fundamental mechanisms, cross-shore and longshore sediment transport, effects of sea level rise on coastal morphology, coastline modelling and coastal protections (e.g., beach nourishment, groynes). In the presence of coastal structures, scour and scour protection will also be introduced.","title":"Coastal Processes and Protection","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"GD: CE5307AQA Ocean Wind and Wave\nUG: CE2134 Fluid Mechanics and CE3132 Hydrology and Free Surface Flows","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CE5308","prereq_tree":{"and":["CE5307AQA","CE2134","CE3132"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,4,3]}
