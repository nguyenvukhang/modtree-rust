In Chinese tradition, the family and the state are, however, inherently connected. Arranged on a chronological and thematic basis, this module provides students an opportunity to survey the development of family‐state relations in Chinese history from the ancient to the modern eras. It examines how different teachings—such as Confucianism and Buddhism—significantly defined family‐state relations and how the popular culture — such as dramas and novels — represented and reshaped these relations over time.","title":"Family-State Relations in Chinese History","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in HY, with a minimum CAP of\n3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"HY4231","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.5,6.0]}
