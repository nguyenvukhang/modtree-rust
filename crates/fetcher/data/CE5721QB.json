The module will focus the potential and diffraction theories on wave loading. These fundamental theories are used widely in the design of offshore infrastructure and renewable energy. The module will also focus on the wind loading which is fundamental to the design of offshore wind turbines.","title":"Ocean Environmental Loads","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Knowledge in water wave mechanics or equivalent","module_credit":"2","module_code":"CE5721QB","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
