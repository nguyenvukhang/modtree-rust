{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Over the past decade, meat alternatives have garnered increasing attention due to the environmental, economic, and ethical issues stemming from traditional meat \nproducts. Creating properties desirable in meat substitutes (e.g., texture, composition, taste) requires the application of tissue engineering principles. Tissue engineering is classically focused on biomedical applications, yet the same driving principles can be employed for creating the perfect meat mimic, while keeping in mind the sustainability and economic feasibility of the product. This module will explore the role of bioengineering in the design, development, and optimisation of meat alternatives for widespread applicability in future foods development.","title":"Tissue Engineering for Designing Food","department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BN5303","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
