The course extends the C programming students have learnt earlier, covers microprocessor instruction sets and how to program microcontrollers to interface with other devices in order to build an embedded system. The course culminates in an assignment in which students design and build an embedded system that meets requirements and specifications.","title":"Microcontroller Programming and Interfacing","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"EE2020E or TEE2020 or TEE2026","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TEE2028","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["EE2020E","TEE2020","TEE2026"]},"fulfill_requirements":["EE3207E","EE3208E","EE4214E","TEE4214","TEE3207","TEE3208"],"workload":[3,1,1,2,3]}
