{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module offers undergraduates the opportunity to pursue 10-12 weeks internships during the summer vacation periods and obtain modular credits. These internships can be technical, general and/or inter-disciplinary in nature, and need not be related to the studentsâ€™ major or discipline.\n\nBefore the internship, students gain experience in the job search process and access to CFG internship preparatory sessions. During internships, students gain work experiences, practise what they have learnt in school, acquire new knowledge and skills, and build their professional networks.\n\nStudents will reflect on these learning experiences through various assessments and receive feedback on their internship performance.","title":"NUS Vacation Internship Programme","department":"Centre for Future-ready Grads","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CFG2101","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,40,0]}
