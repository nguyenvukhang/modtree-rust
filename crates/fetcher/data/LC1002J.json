{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Introduction to Legal Theory introduces the student to theoretical perspectives on law. The sort of topics addressed by legal theory include competing views of the nature of law; different understandings of the social role and social impact of law; attempts to provide a basis for the authority of law; inquiries on the relationship between law and other normative orders, such as morality, ethics, culture and religion; the relationships law as a practice and law as a discipline have with politics, sociology, economics, and the humanities. Legal theory also investigates at an abstract level the way law operates considering how to better understand legal materials, the process of legal reasoning, the judicial role, and legal rights - and in the case of some approaches, produces a radical challenge to the way lawyers conventionally regard the law.","title":"Introduction to Legal Theory (J)","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LC1002J","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,0,0]}
