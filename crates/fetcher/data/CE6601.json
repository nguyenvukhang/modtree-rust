{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Building materials are the corner stones of modern construction practises. Enhancing the performance and sustainability is a major task of research and development of novel building materials, which relies substantially on the characterization of materials. This module targets at audiences who conduct experimental research on a broad spectrum of building materials for all types of applications, such as structure, pavement and ground-stabilization. In this module, students will learn knowledge of designing and conducting the experiments of characterizing the physical and chemical features of building materials, and interpretation of the experimental results.","title":"Characterization of Sustainable Building Materials","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Year 4 standing with pre-requisite knowledge on cement-based composites","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CE6601","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.0,0.5,2.0,4.5]}
