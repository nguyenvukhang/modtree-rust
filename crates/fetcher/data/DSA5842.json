{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods widely used for classification. An SVM discriminates between two classes by generating a decision boundary that optimally separates classes after transforming the input data into a high-dimensional space. SVMs are popular because they are memory efficient and can address a large number of predictor variables. In this course, participants will learn how to build and implement SVMs, and assess their performance. The versatility of SVMs is demonstrated through practical applications.","title":"Learning from Data: Support Vector Machines","department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Passed DSA5831 Learning from Data: Principles and Practice","module_credit":"1","module_code":"DSA5842","prereq_tree":"DSA5831","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[5,4,0,6,5]}
