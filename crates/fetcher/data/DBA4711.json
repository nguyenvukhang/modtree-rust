In this module, we study how analytics is used to transform businesses and industries, using examples and case studies in e-commerce, healthcare, social media, Fintech, pharma, and beyond. Through these examples, students learn the use of predictive and prescriptive analytics methods such as linear regression, logistic regression, classification trees, random forests, social network analysis, time series modelling, clustering, optimization, and machine learning.","title":"Applied Analytics","department":"Analytics and Operations","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"DAO2702 Programming for Business Analytics","module_credit":"4","module_code":"DBA4711","prereq_tree":"DAO2702","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
