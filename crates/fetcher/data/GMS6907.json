{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"With digitalisation of medical records and availability of high-throughput omics technologies, big data is becoming increasingly accessible. However, without formal bioinformatics training, it is easy to get lost in the big data as there could be multiple ways of interpreting them. Moreover, investigator bias may lead to errorneous interpretation of big data that can compromise decision making processes. This module is designed to cover the concepts in big data analyses, including data mining, data preprocessing, data visualisation, pathway enrichment analysis and data dashboarding. Students will also learn the fundamentals of Python programming, which is useful for handling big datasets.","title":"Applied Bioinformatics and Omics Data Analysis","department":"Duke-NUS Dean's Office","faculty":"Duke-NUS Medical School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GMS6907","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,2,0,2,2]}
