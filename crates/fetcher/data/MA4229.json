{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MA3266","description":"Fourier analysis occupies a central position in both pure and applied mathematics. This module introduces some of the main ideas of Fourier analysis while trying to keep the technical prerequisites to a minimum. In particular, Lebesgue integration is not required. Selected applications to approximation problems are presented. Main topics: Fourier series, summability, pointwise and mean square convergence of Fourier series. Fejer’s Theorem, localization principle and Dini’s test. Applications: Weierstrass Approximation Theorem, orthogonal polynomials, mean square approximation, best uniform polynomial approximation.","title":"Fourier Analysis and Approximation","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(MA2101 or MA2101S) and (MA2108 or MA2108S)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MA4229","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["MA2101","MA2101S"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA2108","MA2108S"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["MA5241","MA5242"],"workload":[3,1,0,0,6]}
