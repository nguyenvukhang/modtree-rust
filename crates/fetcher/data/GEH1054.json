{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GEM1031, GEC1018","description":"This module focuses on names as a means of marking out the socio-cultural identity of the named and of the namer. Attention will be paid to anthroponyms (personal names), toponyms (place names) and commercial names. This module will be interdisciplinary in nature and will combine a range of approaches to names. Linguistic and philosophical approaches will provide the theoretical anchor to the topic of names. Subsequent seminars will contextualise names in their historical, geographical, political and literary contexts. There will be scope for students to develop the module in the direction of their interests in the mini project.","title":"Names as Markers of Socio-cultural Identity","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GEH1054","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,2,5]}
