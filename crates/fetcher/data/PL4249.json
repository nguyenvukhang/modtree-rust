In this seminar, we will undertake a broad survey of the field, focusing on how mindfulness meditation changes the body, the brain and the mind. We will examine the evidence for the effects of mindfulness on cognition, emotion, stress, sleep, brain structure and function, physiology, and its uses in treating psychopathology. Mindfulness teachers, practitioners, clinicians, and app developers will be invited to share their experience and knowledge with the class.","title":"The Psychology and Neuroscience of Mindfulness","department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs of which student must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132 and 4 out of the 5 core modules (PL3232/PL3102 â€“ PL3236/PL3106), which should include PL3232/PL3102 and PL3236/PL3106, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"PL4249","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,6.5]}
