{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The public’s perception of nuclear power sharply deteriorated because of the 2011 Fukushima reactor core meltdown and several other prior accidents. However, given the urgent need to fight climate change and the current global energy crisis caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the case for nuclear power is becoming ever stronger. Considering the associated risks, what role should radiation play in society?
