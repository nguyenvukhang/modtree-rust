{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EE5439, EE6439","description":"This module aims to provide students with the knowledge of sensors and sensing technology for smart home applications based on artificial intelligence-enabled data\nanalytics and sensor fusion. Student will learn about the fundamentals of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) through hands-on practice. Students will\ncreate VR/AR smart home applications through the labs and hands-on projects to demonstrate human-machine real-time interaction in a smart home. The sensory\ninformation of users and environmental conditions will be analyzed by deep learning approaches and provided to a VR/AR-enabled duplicated home in the virtual space.","title":"AI Sensors and Virtual/Augmented Reality Technologies","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Background knowledge in programming environments such as Python/MATLAB, or be able to program in standard languages such as C, C++, Java, etc.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5205","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,2,2,4]}
