{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"YSC3205 Linear Algebra or MA1101R Linear Algebra I or MA1508E Linear Algebra for Engineering or MA1513 Linear Algebra with Differential Equations","description":"A first course in linear algebra of finite-dimensional real and complex vector spaces, balancing theoretical and computational material. The course covers vectors and linear transformations, building geometric intuition, algebraic aptitude, and computational proficiency. Topics include spaces and subspaces, linear maps, linear independence and spanning, basis, and representations by coordinates and matrices. The theory of linear operators is developed, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors, self-adjoint operators, the spectral theorem, and the singular value decomposition. Some topics from numerical linear algebra, especially implementation of algorithms and assessment of their efficiency are included. Applications to statistics, economics, engineering and science are presented.","title":"Linear Algebra","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science or YSC1216 Calculus or YSC2203 Classical Mechanics or YSC2209 Proof or YSC2239 Introduction to Data Science or YSS2211 Econometrics or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC2232","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["YSC1212","YSC1216","YSC2203","YSC2209","YSC2239","YSS2211"]},"fulfill_requirements":["YSC3206","YSC4206","YSC4216","YSC4220","YSC4227"],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
