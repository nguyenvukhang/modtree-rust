{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Shakespeare is by far the most produced and adapted western playwright in East Asian theatre cultures. Approaches to translating, performing and re‚Äêwriting his plays have changed over time, and are now at their most diverse and experimental. Correlatively, connections and relationships between Asian and Anglophone performance histories have also matured. Using translated and annotated archival recordings, this module examines the historical contexts and theatrical concerns of East Asian Shakespeare performances, relating them comparatively to Anglophone and European textual and performance histories. It is jointly taught by NUS and The Shakespeare Institute, University of Birmingham as a distance learning module.","title":"Performing Shakespeare in Asia","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate student in the university or with the approval of the Department.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TS5213","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,1,1,0,7]}
