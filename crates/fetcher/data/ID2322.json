{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The objective of this module is to introduce students to the materials that are commonly used in the manufacture and fabrication of products. It will enable students to acquire knowledge on the properties and performance of materials and enable them to select materials for specific design applications. The module will also introduce contemporary, designerly approaches to material and production, from high tech composite materials, to novel one-off or batch production techniques invented by designer-makers. Knowledge of production processes associated with materials and its appropriate applications is a required skill for any designer involved in the design of products such as consumer electronics, domestic appliances, kitchen wares, furniture, lighting, and packaging. Students are expected to gain an operationally-ready level of mastery through hands-on experimentation and visits to industry practices. This module will train students with practical know-how on engineering materials and the production processes used in mass manufacturing and small scale production. It will present guidelines to assist the designer in selecting the most appropriate materials and manufacturing methods for a given purpose or application. At the end of the module, students should gain sufficient knowledge in various materials and manufacturing technologies so as to be able to communicate effectively with production engineers to materialise their design concept.","title":"Materials and Production","department":"Industrial Design","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ID2322","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,6,0]}
