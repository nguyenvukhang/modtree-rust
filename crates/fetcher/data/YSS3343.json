{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Plato’s political thought has long been considered to be a direct response to the trial and death of Socrates, a revenge against democratic Athens. However, this is not obvious. This module will introduce students to a number of Platonic dialogues, like the Apology, Phaedo, and Republic, among others, in which the development of Socrates as a thinker, as well as the ever-present tension between philosophy and politics, are explored. It will then question long-held views on the way we should approach the dialogues, particularly regarding their chronology, content, and intent. Readings will include both primary and secondary sources.","title":"Plato’s Political Thought","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS3343","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
