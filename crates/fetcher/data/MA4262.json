{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This is an introduction to the theory of Lebesgue measure and Lebesgue integration, with an eye to\nexamples and applications drawn from probability theory. In addition to those majoring in mathematics, it\nmay be of interest to students in statistics, science, engineering or economics who wish to acquire a\nworking knowledge of the modern approach to integration. Major topics include: construction of Lebesgue\nmeasure, definition of Lebesgue integral, convergence theorems, applications to probability such as the\nBorel-Cantelli Lemma, Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.","title":"Measure and Integration","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA3210","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MA4262","prereq_tree":"MA3210","fulfill_requirements":["MA5205","MA5206","MA5248","MA5259"],"workload":[3,1,0,0,6]}
