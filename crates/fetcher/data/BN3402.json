{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course personifies the interdisciplinary nature of bioengineering by providing an in-depth understanding of the fundamentals of analytical chemistry and biology. Emphasis will be placed on evidence-based concepts of selected analytical methodologies for the characterization of cells and biomolecules, through study of real-world applications. These methodologies include structural (e.g., microscopy), chemical (e.g., spectroscopy) and molecular (e.g. electrophoresis) experiments. Importance will be given to experimental design, problem-solving, and interpretation of data. At the end of the course, students will be competent to critically appraise analytical techniques adopted by researchers and make well-informed decisions on the selection of a suitable analytical method.","title":"Bio-Analytics for Engineers","department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BN3402","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,2,0,3,4]}
