{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GEX1031","description":"Hollywood cinema is arguably the most popular and dominant cinema in the world but it is also a group style that represents a particular mode of expression and approach to the cinematic medium. This module explores the ways that Hollywood has used film form to create a naturalised style and viewing experience. We will study its conventions as well as the variations and deviations that push the envelope or constitute alternative constructions of the realistic. This module is 100% CA and some of the films studied may have mature content.","title":"Hollywood Cinema: Constructing the Realistic","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GET1044","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,1,6]}
