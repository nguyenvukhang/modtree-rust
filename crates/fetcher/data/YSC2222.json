{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The structure, properties, and reactivity of carbon-based molecules will be directly observed and inferred in this laboratory-based course, which supplements YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry. Students will put their newly acquired theoretical knowledge in practice and thus gain a much deeper understanding of the material. Topics include reaction set-up and purification, IR, NMR, GC-MS and LC-MS analysis, as well as an advanced synthesis project.","title":"Organic Chemistry Laboratory","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC2224 Accelerated Organic Chemistry or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC2222","prereq_tree":"YSC2224","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,6.5]}
