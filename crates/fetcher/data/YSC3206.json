{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MA2108 Mathematical Analysis I and MA3110 Mathematical Analysis II","description":"This course embarks on a deep study of the real numbers and functions of a\nsingle real variable. Fundamental properties of real numbers – arithmetic,\ndistance, limit, convergence, order – are developed from scratch. From\nthere, the course delves into the inner workings of calculus, the general\nnotions of continuity, differentiability, measure, and integration, for\nfunctions of one real variable.","title":"Introduction to Real Analysis","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC2209 Proof or YSC2232 Linear Algebra or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC3206","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["YSC2209","YSC2232"]},"fulfill_requirements":["YSC4210"],"workload":[0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,8.5]}
