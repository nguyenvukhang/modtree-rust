{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"With the growing influence of Data Science, the Statistics and Mathematics domains now require specific skills in programming, using domain-specific systems and libraries. This course introduces common tools for  Data Science programming. This includes a high-level language (i.e. Python), several Statistics/AI libraries (i.e. numpy, sklearn), and database systems (i.e. SQL). In addition we will create awareness of best practices in programming such as control versioning, testing, and continuous integration.","title":"Programming for Data Science","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC2244","prereq_tree":"YSC1212","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,6.0,3.5]}
