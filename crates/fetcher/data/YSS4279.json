{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The body is often taken for granted as a material substrate of cultural existence. This course places the human body at the forefront of investigation. Students will study the relationship among body, mind, and society. We begin by examining how conceptions of the body are linked to histories of domination and colonialism. We then move to study the lived body, paying attention to the culturally specific ways the body is produced and experienced and its relationship with practice, performance, affect, time, and space. The course closes with examining the commodification of the body and the emergence of new cyborg bodies.","title":"Body and Society","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought and at least one 2000 or 3000-level anthropology courses.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS4279","prereq_tree":"YCC2121","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.5,9.0]}
