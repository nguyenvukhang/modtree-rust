{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Is the library a laboratory of knowledge or its mausoleum? How is knowledge created and destroyed? How did people cope with information overload in the early modern period? This course is about the formation of the individual through the construction of the private study and the institution library. Our historical immersion is late-sixteenth century Europe, a pivotal period of enormous cultural, religious, and technological changes. We will examine literary masterworksâ€”Petrarch, Machiavelli, Montaigne, Cervantes, Marlowe, and explore visual arts of the Renaissance. We will consider other sites of knowledge such as the cabinet of curiosities, museums, anatomy galleries and gardens.","title":"The Renaissance Library","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3384","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,9.5]}
