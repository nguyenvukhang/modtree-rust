{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"In this module we will explore material science from the point of view of optical techniques. Students will learn how to select appropriate optical tools to get insight into electronic band structure of metals, semiconductors and insulators based on analysis of raw experimental data obtained in realistic experiments. We will discuss the fabrication of luminescent devices in nanoscale and engineering of the crystal lattice at atomic level to create quantum emitters. We will introduce simple modelling techniques for optical processes in solids illustrated by schematic diagrams prepared by students.","title":"Materials for Optics: from Quantum Light to Nanodevices","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MLE4219","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
