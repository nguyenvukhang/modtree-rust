{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Biotechnology plays increasingly important roles in chemical manufacturing, because it can utilize renewable resources and carry out the reactions at milder, safer and more environmentally-friendly conditions. This module introduces the foundational molecular biology tools that have enabled many biotechnological processes. To enable the students to have hands-on experiences with these theories, this module is also heavy in using computational tools during teaching and assessments. The computations would allow the students to practice the theories in silico and be able to handle large volume of data that are being generated by the omics technologies in many biotechnological applications.","title":"Molecular and computational tools for biotechnology","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Linear algebra and numerical methods at undergraduate level, Fundamentals of Biochemistry","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN5252","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
