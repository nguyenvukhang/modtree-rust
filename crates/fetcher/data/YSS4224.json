{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The 20th and 21st centuries have seen an unprecedented global expansion in the number of one-party regimes. Despite not conforming to standard definitions of democracy, these regimes have proven more stable and developed faster than non-democracies with which they are often grouped. In this module, students will gain a deeper understanding of politics within such regimes from a comparative politics perspective. Topics covered include the conditions facilitating the establishment and spread of one-party regimes, how leaders manage threats originating from both inside and outside the regime, the role of elections, and the conditions in which transitions away from regimes occur.","title":"Political Order and One-Party Rule","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSS1206 Introduction to Comparative Politics or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS4224","prereq_tree":"YSS1206","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,4.5,5.0]}
