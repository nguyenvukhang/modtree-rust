{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This introduction to dance-making module is based on the central outcome of “dancing for wellness” as all art forms have inherent healing properties. Students will go on a journey of self-exploration to answer the research question on “Who am I? Where am I going and how do I get there?” Students will learn basic dance composition techniques, experiment, choreograph, reflect, and perform their own solo work using their individual stories as an impetus for personal healing, transformation, and growth. This performative practice will encourage the development of artistry as well as impact an audience consisting of their peers.","title":"Dance Narratives","department":"NUS College","faculty":"NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NHT2204","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,0,7]}
