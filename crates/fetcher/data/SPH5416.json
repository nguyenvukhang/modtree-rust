{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"To meet the challenge of an ageing population, increasing chronic diseases and escalating healthcare costs, there is an opportunity for healthcare delivery to be better integrated. However, integrated care is a complex knowledge domain, with macro, meso and micro levels of theory and practice. This course provides students with the theoretical foundation and methodological enablers of integrated care. It introduces students to systematic methods to evaluate integrated care services, systems, pilots and interventions, including methods to enable large scale integration of care. Students will be able to apply learning to strengthen their own integrated care practice or research.","title":"Introduction to Integrated Care","department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SPH5416","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
