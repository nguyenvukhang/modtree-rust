{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course follows up on Macroeconomics I (EC2102).  We review consumption and investment theories, and study the determinants of money demand and supply.  Aggregate Supply functions under differing assumptions regarding labour-market clearing and price expectations (rational or adaptive) are derived next, and combined with the Aggregate Demand function to study policy and other effects.  We next examine the expectations-augmented Phillips Curve, and simple inflation-unemployment dynamics.  We also study further policy issues (time inconsistency, Ricardian Equivalence, profit-sharing), open-economy macroeconomics (the Mundell-Fleming model), and simple growth theory (the Solow model and the AK endogenous growth model).","title":"Macroeconomic Analysis II","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EC2102, EC2101, AND (EC2104 OR ANY MA MODULE THAT IS NOT MA1301/MA1301FC/MA1301X OR MA1311 OR MA1312 OR MA1421)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EC3102","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["EC3880A","EC3395"],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
