{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The challenge of managing successfully, self, and others, in an increasingly complex and global environment is the focus of this module. The module leads students to develop a deeper understanding of how management practices and processes can often differ across national and regional boundaries, and why. Students are also led to consider the social identities that they and cultural others bring to cross-cultural interactions. Leveraging on such understanding, managers will learn to explore strategies and tactics for navigating these differences to develop global management capabilities.","title":"Managing Across Cultures","department":"BIZ Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BMS5416","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":"0-3-04-3"}
