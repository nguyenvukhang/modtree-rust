{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"From zebra stripes and rose petal spirals to swarming bird flocks, the biological world is full of mesmerizing patterns. How do these patterns form, and what is the underlying mechanism that explains these seemingly unrelated phenomena? This module takes an interdisciplinary approach to introduce how complex biological phenomena can emerge from simple rules. Through interactive lectures, guided reading and hands-on tutorials and simulations, students will learn to appreciate how basic concepts like feedback and robustness generate biodiversity across multiples scales.","title":"Pattern Formation and Self-organisation in Biology","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"LSM2234 Introduction to Quantitative Biology\nOR\nLSM2302 Computational Thinking for Life Sciences","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LSM3236","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["LSM2234","LSM2302"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,2,4]}
