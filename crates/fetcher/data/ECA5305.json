{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module will introduce our economic students to practical approaches to handling all kinds of data using R programming language. Students will first learn how to code like a programmer and learn how to work with common data structures in R before expanding their skills to wrangling data, summarizing and visualizing the data, and addressing data quality problems. Then, we will explore different packages which are widely used and powerful for data manipulations. We expect the course to equip the students with relevant data analyzing skills using one of the most programming languages for work or further studies.","title":"R Programming for Economists","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ECA5305","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
