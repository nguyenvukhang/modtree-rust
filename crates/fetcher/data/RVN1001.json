{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This interdisciplinary module allows students to reassess their understanding of the natural world in a highly urbanised context. Through active participation in a community partner project, students will reassess their relationship with nature, and analyse the environmental, social, and economic consequences of current mass extinction and rapid biodiversity loss. Based on collaborative and outdoor learning, students will critically evaluate rewilding strategies and put them into action in service of the Singapore community. This module engages students in fieldtrips, surveys, peer-teaching, and participation in a community-based rewilding project, consolidating learnt skills in the proposal of a realistic local mini-rewilding project.","title":"The Great Extinction: rewilding and conservation","department":"Ridge View Residential College","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"RVN1001","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,5,2]}
