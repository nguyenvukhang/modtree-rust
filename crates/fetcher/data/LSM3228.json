{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"In nature, microbes exist as multispecies communities (microbiota) interacting with each other and also the environment/host. This typically occurs in the context of biofilms where organisms are in close proximity within a protected environment of the biofilm matrix. This module primarily explores the human microbiome and its effect on development and disease, and explore the role of pre- and pro-biotics in health. Mechanistic insights into microbial communities can also be gained through more controlled studies focusing on experimental biofilms. Appreciating the biology of biofilms allows us to understand the context that both human and environmental microbiota operate in.","title":"Microbiomes and Biofilms","department":"Microbiology and Immunology","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","prerequisite":"LSM2191 Laboratory Techniques in Life Sciences\nor\nLSM2291 Fundamental Techniques in Microbiology","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LSM3228","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["LSM2191","LSM2291"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,2,4,2]}
