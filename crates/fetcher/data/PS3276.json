{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This upper-level seminar surveys the literature on comparative political behaviour with cases drawn from South, Southeast, and East Asia. Given how broad the comparative political behaviour literature is, we will cover only some of the most studied topics. These topics include voting behaviour, political identities, and political participation. Since no individuals live in a vacuum, we also will cover how individuals and political behaviour are constrained by political system and political culture.","title":"Comparative Political Behaviour","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PS3276","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
