{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"YSS3221 Politics of Southeast Asia","description":"Southeast Asiaâ€™s fascinating array of experiences and outcomes within and across countries provides an interesting opportunity for answering key questions in political science. We will examine issues related to the mobilization of communal ties, nation-building policies, political representation and governance, everyday interactions between citizens and between citizens and the state, and protests and violent mobilization. We will read classical and new works in social sciences, that offer insights into the variation we see in the region. This class builds on some of the concepts and topics already covered in International Relations, International Development, Methods in Social Sciences, and Comparative Politics.","title":"Politics of Southeast Asia","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1121 Comparative Social Inquiry, YCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning and YSS3231 Methods in the Social Sciences, or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS4272","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["YCC1121","YCC1122"]},"YSS3231"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
