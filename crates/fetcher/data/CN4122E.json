{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"TCN4122","description":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical\nprocesses.","title":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"CN2116E Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121E Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN3124E Particle Technology\nCN3132E Separation Processes","module_credit":"3","module_code":"CN4122E","prereq_tree":{"and":["CN2116E","CN2121E","CN3124E","CN3132E"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["CN4123E","CN4124E"],"workload":[2.0,2.0,0.0,1.5,2.0]}
