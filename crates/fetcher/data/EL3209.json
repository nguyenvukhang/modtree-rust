{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"It is generally assumed that language, culture, and our way of thinking are related. The relation, which is often called the Sapir‚ÄêWhorf Hypothesis or linguistic relativity, has been the subject of serious philosophical, anthropological and scientific inquiry. Taking advantage of the extensive bilingualism in Singapore, this module selects a few salient grammatical features and critically examines them within the broader cultural and/or cognitive contexts. Topics to be discussed include pluralisation, classifier, tense and aspect, kinship, polysemy, metaphor and bilingual acquisition. Issues related to translation will also be discussed.","title":"Language, Culture, and Mind","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EL1101E or GEK1011.
