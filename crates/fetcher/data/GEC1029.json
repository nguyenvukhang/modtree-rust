The module uses football as a window into: contextual and environmental variegation in human practices; worldly cultural politics (along lines of age, (dis)ability, class, gender, and race, among others); and processes through which everyday lifeworlds are bound up with distant and not-so-distant people and places.","title":"Worlds of Football","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GEC1029","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,4,3]}
