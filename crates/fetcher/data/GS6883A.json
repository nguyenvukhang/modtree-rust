{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module consists of a series of lectures and discussions/presentations that would provide students with an interdisciplinary exposure and knowledge foundation for selected research areas/themes that are of prime importance to humankind, and where interdisciplinary science and engineering are frequently practiced. Some of these areas are traditional strategic areas which NUS have great research strength in, and others are emerging areas of intense interest. Each theme is taught and coordinated by two instructors, who will contribute to different, yet complementary, perspectives of the theme. The areas/themes may include \"infectious agents and global pandemics\", \"Omics\", \"Renewable Energy\", \"Human-Computer Interactions\" and \"Environmental problems/climate change\".","title":"Interface Science and Engineering","department":"NUSGS Deanâ€™s Office","faculty":"NUS Graduate School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"2","module_code":"GS6883A","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[]}
