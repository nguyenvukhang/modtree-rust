Students can thus understand why labour relations are the way they are in Singapore. In addition, the course is not purely historical. A substantial part of the course is also aimed at looking at the current legal problems faced by employees and employers in Singapore. This course will be of general relevance to all as students are in all likelihood going to be employees or employers some day.","title":"Singapore Employment Law and Policies","department":"Strategy and Policy","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GESS1036","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
