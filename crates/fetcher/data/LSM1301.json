The concept of how organisms maintain their internal constancy and organisation of major organ systems will be discussed. The focus will be to introduce the unifying concepts in biology and how they play a role in everyday life.","title":"General Biology","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LSM1301","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["LSM2212","LSM2233","LSM2106","LSM2291","LSM2251","LSM2241","LSM2252","LSM2234","LSM1111","LSM2105","LSM2107","LSM2302","FST1101B"],"workload":[2,0,2,2,4]}
