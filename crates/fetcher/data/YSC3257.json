{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Molecular Biology is the study of the mechanisms by which genetic information is replicated, recombined, repaired, transcribed, and translated, and the various ways in which the expression of that information is regulated. Commonalities among bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes highlight the unifying principles of life, while the difference between and within the groups attest to the roles of contingency and selection in the evolution of regulatory mechanisms.  In addition to classical, mechanistic molecular biology, we will see how genomic analysis adds to our understanding by revealing the results of evolutionary drift and selection, subject to those mechanisms.","title":"Molecular Biology","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Recommended any 2000 level Life Sciences course, or suitable preparation in secondary school and with the permission from the instructor. \nSuitable preparation in secondary school will generally mean a 5 on the AP Biology exam, the equivalent in an IB program, or an H3 in Singapore.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC3257","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
