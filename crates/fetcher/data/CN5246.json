{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CN4246R Chemical and Bio-catalysis","description":"Students will learn the concepts of heterogeneous catalysis with increasing complexities, starting from those involving polymeric phases, enzyme pockets, up to those involving zeolite cages and complex oxide surfaces. To achieve these, students will learn steady state approximation, catalytic cycles, catalyst structures, reaction mechanisms & kinetics, transport phenomena (diffusion, mass and heat transfer), and reaction engineering. Many reactions and catalysts of industrial importance will be emphasised throughout the module to illustrate these principles. Students will then learn how to apply their knowledge of these principles to the design of catalysts, reaction mechanism, and reaction kinetics rate laws for reactor design.","title":"Catalysis Science and Engineering","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN5246","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.5,0.0,3.0,3.5]}
