{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Play is often seen as not serious, separate from the real world, and serving no purpose. However, play is essential for our cognitive, emotional and social development, creativity, and interaction with the world. Play is also something that animals, not just humans, engage in. Starting from the perspective of play as free movement within constraints, students will explore the concept of play across disciplines, in both theory and practice, so as to appreciate its central role in our lives. This can involve field observation of animal play, lab work using play as a mode of enquiry, and role-playing for problem-solving.","title":"“Do Play Play”: The Importance of Play","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Priority for CHS students","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HS2902","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,4,2]}
