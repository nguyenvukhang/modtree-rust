{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EL2202","description":"This course introduces students to phonetics – which is concerned with speech sounds as physical objects – and phonology – which is concerned with the organization of speech sounds in a linguistic system. We will learn about the human speech apparatus in detail, the mechanisms that are involved in speech production, as well as the acoustic properties of speech sounds. Starting with examples from English, we will explore phonological patterns from a crosslinguistic perspective, and learn how to provide formal analyses for these patterns. The course teaches conceptual tools that will allow students to analyse the phonology of English and other languages.","title":"Sound Patterns in Language","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EL1101E or GEK1011","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EL2102","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["EL1101E","GEK1011"]},"fulfill_requirements":["EL3202","EL3230","EL3205","EL3231"],"workload":[0,0,0,3,7]}
