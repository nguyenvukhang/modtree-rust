But in the 13th century, they were known as the capital vices. This course explores the rich tradition of philosophical reflection on these vices through the works of Thomas Aquinas. In particular, this course will focus on Aquinasâ€™s De Malo, in which Aquinas synthesizes medieval Catholic asceticism and Aristotelian natural philosophy to provide an in-depth treatment on all things to do with evil. The questions addressed in this course includes: What makes each of these traits vicious? What sets them apart from other vices? How can we combat these vices in our lives?","title":"Thomas Aquinas on Evil","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3375","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.5,6.0]}
