{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"DTK1234 Design Thinking","description":"In this module, students use design principles to develop their creative potential and practise design thinking using a people-centered approach to solve problems and create new possibilities. Through practical activities, students will discover tools and mindsets that guide them in navigating ambiguity in a creative process, observing and learning from others in unfamiliar contexts, and generating and experimenting with ideas quickly. While students draw on design thinking as a personal creative skillset, they will also value the impact of design that affords people the opportunity and privilege to shape the world that they, and others, inhabit. DTK1234A is a variant module of DTK1234, co-taught by studio tutors. Learning objectives are applied to address spatial issues via projects undertaken in AR1101 or LAD1001.","title":"Design Thinking","department":"Industrial Design","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"DTK1234A","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,2,0,5,2]}
