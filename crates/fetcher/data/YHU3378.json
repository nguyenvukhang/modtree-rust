{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Even for someone who is very socio-politically apathetic, populism, as a contemporary (political?, cultural? social?) phenomenon is hard to miss. But what exactly is populism? How is it similar (and, how is it different) in (across) the many different social contexts where it is expressed? This course attempts to further our understanding of populism by isolating its logic, its ontological, epistemic and ethical commitments.  It also assesses whether a susceptibility to populist pressures inheres in us or is merely an idiosyncratic response to our epoch. Finally, it considers what populism implies for, inter alia, nationalism, liberalism and constitutional democracy.","title":"Contemporary Populism: Logic, Method and Implications","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3378","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.5,6.0]}
