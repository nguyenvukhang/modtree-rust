{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces the analytical tools of macroeconomics and applies them extensively to Asia. The course begins with the analysis of business cycles and the role of stabilization policy. It then moves on to the open economy. Key issues covered include: the determination of exchange rate in the short- and long-run, how currency risk can be hedged, how economic “shocks” are transmitted internationally and what policy can achieve in response. Additional topics include: determinants of economic growth in the long run with lessons from Asia, challenges facing the Chinese economy, and perspectives on financial crises and financial regulation.","title":"Asia and the Global Economy","department":"BIZ Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BME5050","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[32,0,0,0,30]}
