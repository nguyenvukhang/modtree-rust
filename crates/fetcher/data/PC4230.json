{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"PC4130","description":"This third undergraduate module in quantum mechanics starts with a recap of the main contents covered by lower-level quantum mechanics courses, in particular time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theory, with more depth. Matlab is introduced to implement the discrete variable representation to solve time-independent Schrodinger equations, and the Split-Operator technique to solve time-dependent Schrodinger equations, with necessary coding from the stratch. This module also covers a number of frontiers topics, including adiabatic theorem, adiabatic control, shortcuts to adiabaticity, geometric phases, density matrix, reduced density matrix, quantum measurement models, quantum master equations, spin-boson model, decoherence, and dynamical decoupling.","title":"Quantum Mechanics III","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC3130","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC4230","prereq_tree":"PC3130","fulfill_requirements":["PC5206"],"workload":[3,2,0,0,5]}
