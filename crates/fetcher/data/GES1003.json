{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GEK2001, SSA2202, GESS1001","description":"This module attempts to understand the rationale of changes in Singapore's urban landscape.  It places these changes within a framework that considers Singapore's efforts to globalise and examines how policies are formulated with the idea of sustaining an economy that has integral links sub-regionally with Southeast Asia while developing new spatial linkages that will strengthen its position in the global network.  Emphasis is also given to recent discussions about how diversity and difference in the perception and use of space pose a challenge to the utilitarian and functional definition adopted by the state.","title":"Changing Landscapes of Singapore","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GES1003","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[]}
