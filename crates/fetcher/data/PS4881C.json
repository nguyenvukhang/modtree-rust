{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This seminar considers working class participation in the political economy, including labour market regulation, national labour administration, state-labour ties, labour-business relations, the structural conditions underpinning labour-capital relations and labour representation in the political arena. Attention is given to corporatist, neo-corporatist and pluralist forms of labour politics and to some of the ways labour enters the political system for example, as autonomous, state or party-dependent, nondependent party-affiliated, pressure group, social movement or unorganized activity. Issues of format, scope, and participation in collective bargaining will be addressed, as will principal-agent and other collective action logics.","title":"Topics in CP: Labour Politics","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"PS4881C","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,7.5]}
