{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"YHU4102 Literature Capstone Project","description":"This module is exclusively for those students taking the non-thesis capstone option; it forms the second component along with an additional 5MC Literature module. Students will write an independent extended research essay associated with a 4000-level literature elective. In consultation with a Faculty supervisor, a student will plan to expand an assigned essay into a larger research project that demonstrates similar analytic and formal qualities expected of the Literature capstone thesis, but in a more limited format, of between 5000-5500 words. Students will present on their extended research essay in an end-of-year research symposium.","title":"Extended Research Essay in Literature","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU4265","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.5]}
