{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Singapore is one of the most successful countries that manages to strike a balance between government-led and market-led growth. This hybrid economic model is possible because of the governance and political philosophy that the Singapore government adopts. \n\nDifferent from other countries where policies are made along political lines and ideologies, the Singapore government has chosen pragmatism as the principal governance philosophy, prioritising long-term stable growth over short-term gains. \n\nThis module adopts an inter-disciplinary approach to study the political economy of Singapore by examining how macro issues like growth, distribution, and welfare are shaped by political behaviours, public institutions, and laws.","title":"Singapore Governance's Success","department":"Management and Organisation","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"1","module_code":"BMC5035N","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,9,0,4,0]}
