{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Module explores the meaning of contemporary artistic practices with a focus on conceptual methodologies. How can we process the challenges of our political period of uncertainties - climate change, demographic shifts, international conflicts etc. - with artistic means of expression? What tools and esthetics need to be studied, developed, invented today?  Each week will demonstrate a different approach either by using a creative medium, analytic method and/or examples from contemporary art history. Students will familiarize themselves with manifold forms of artistic practice and research methods across different media and disciplines to develop workplans for their varied projects and research.","title":"Learning by (un)doing - Artistic Practice in Grim Times","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU2336","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,6.5]}
