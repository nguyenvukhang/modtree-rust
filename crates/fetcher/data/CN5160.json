{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Catalysis plays a key role to tackle the increasing societal\ndemand for sustainable production. The module\nintroduces “disruptive innovations” in catalysis that may\nrevolutionize the way to conduct catalytic reactions, and/or\nfundamentally change the views on catalytic active sites\nand cycles. The module consists of five core contents: 1)\nadvanced catalytic kinetic concepts including multiscale\nmodelling and energetic span model; 2) advanced\nsynthetic procedures affording catalyst with high structural\nprecision and complexity; 3) in situ characterization tools;\n4) catalysis beyond thermal activation; and 5) emerging\nfrontiers, such as auxiliary promotion, dynamic catalysis,\ndata-driven catalyst design etc.","title":"Advanced Topics in Catalysis","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"N.A.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN5160","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,2,5]}
