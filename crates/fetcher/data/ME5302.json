{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This graduate level module introduces students to the application of numerical methods for solving incompressible fluid flow and convective heat transfer problems. Major topics covered include: review of theory of numerical discretisation/approximations numerical techniques for elliptic and parabolic PDEs; conservation form; finite-volume discretisation; boundary layer problems; solving Navier-Stokes equations in streamfunction-vorticity and primitive-variables formulations; SIMPLE/R and related procedures; Artificial Compressibility Method; Marker-Cell procedures; steady-state, transient and pseudo-transient methods/approaches. Knowledge in fluid dynamics and heat transfer is presumed. Theory is reinforced by mini-projects. The module is recommended for students who intend to pursue graduate research that requires the application of CFD.","title":"Computational Fluid Mechanics","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"ME2135","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME5302","prereq_tree":"ME2135","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.5,0.0,4.0,3.0]}
