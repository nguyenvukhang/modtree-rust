{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Engineers often have to deal with problems that go beyond their technical domains. How can one solve problems that we are not trained in? What are the guiding principles for good problem-solving? \n\nThis module introduces students to the craft and science of problem-solving and creativity. We will examine the similarities and differences between established problem-solving methodologies such as design thinking, business process re-engineering (BPR) and TQMâ€™s DMAIC. Participants will learn the importance of comprehensiveness, creativity, and convergence in problem-solving, By learning the language and terminologies common in problem-solving, participants will learn the principles and skills of creative problem-solving.","title":"Creativity and Problem-Solving Skills","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MT5021","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,5,2]}
