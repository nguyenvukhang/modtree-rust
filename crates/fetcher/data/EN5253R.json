{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module addresses issues of historical trauma and cultural memory; through a focus on how such memory is manifested in aesthetic (primarily literary) representation. The module assumes a dual approach to the study of selected texts, requiring attention to the topic of violence and memory on the one hand; and the ethics and politics of representation on the other.  Literary texts will illuminate problems of narrative agency, responsibility and testimony in the aftermath of a violent past. The conceptual framework of discussions derive from Maurice Blanchot and his influence on post-structuralism, and from contemporary uses of psychoanalysis by literary theorists.","title":"Writing in the Aftermath","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Must be registered as a Graduate student in the university or with the approval of the Department.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"EN5253R","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
