{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This is an advanced graduate-level module aimed at research and geotechnical-specialist coursework students. Its aim is to introduce students to advanced geotechnical analysis, which is essential and important to deep excavation and tunnel design. Students will learn advanced concepts of finite element analysis needed for the solution of geotechnical problems. It will cover non-linear analysis techniques, elasto-plastic formulation with a tangent stiffness approach, solution techniques, large strain analysis, seepage analysis and coupled consolidation analysis. In combination with CE5010QA, CE5010QB and CE6101, this module forms a complete numerical package targeted towards geotechnical specialists who need to conduct advanced numerical analysis.","title":"Geotechnical Analysis","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CE6102","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,1,6]}
