{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module provides an introduction to surface physics for graduate and year-4 undergraduate students major in physics, chemistry and materials science and engineering.  It covers the properties of solid surfaces, experimental techniques and applications. The topics include the importance of surfaces in science & technology, surface crystallography and topography, surface energy and stress, surface electronic properties (surface states, work function, band bending and Fermi level pining at semiconductor surface/interface, magnetism), surface phonon and plasmon, adsorption, desorption and reaction on surfaces. The applications of basic surface science knowledge in semiconductor technology, materials growth and processing, heterogeneous catalysis, nanoscience and thin film technology will be demonstrated.  Experimental techniques, such as XPS, UPS, AES, LEED, STM, AFM, SIMS, EELS, TPD and vacuum technology, will be addressed with examples and applications. To take this module, students should have a basic knowledge of quantum physics, thermodynamics and solid state physics.","title":"Topics in Surface Physics","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC4223 or PC4259 or departmental approval","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC5205","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["PC4223","PC4259"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,1,1,4]}
