It  incorporates basic concepts, data sources and tools used in demography into a systems approach to modelling population dynamics.\n\nStudents will build models of increasing complexity, covering a variety of generic structures and classic system dynamics modelling scenarios.","title":"Thinking in Systems: Population Dynamics","department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTC1702D","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,2,0,4,4]}
