{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Political ecology is a vibrant interdisciplinary field for critically investigating complex relations between environment and society, paying close attention to power and politics. This module traces the foundations of the field, particularly within geography, and its diverse epistemological approaches, which address how capitalism, knowledge, gender, race, and more shape human interactions with biophysical natures. The module covers current themes such as decolonization, urbanization, and climate change and is intended for graduate students with and without a political ecology background. Students will gain the theoretical tools and analytical skills necessary to understand, and address, urgent contemporary environmental and social problems.","title":"Political Ecology: People, Power, and Nature","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GE5229","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
