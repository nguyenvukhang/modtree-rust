{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"From the invention of the axe to surveying tools like the graphometre, technological advancements have always influenced how we document, understand, design and modify our landscapes. Perhaps the most influential was Geographic Information System (GIS) technology which allowed the convergence of topological, ecological and even social data into the discourse of landscape architecture. However, unlike the two-dimensional nature of GIS, landscapes are inherently three dimensional. The course thus explores the various advances that allow landscape architects to operate within a 3D environment with data collected from reality, studied and modified through computational thinking and enriched through information modelling.","title":"Digital Techniques In Landscape Architecture","department":"Architecture","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LAD4006","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
