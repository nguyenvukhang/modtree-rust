{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module examines historically significant sculptures, architecture and paintings that are produced in Southeast Asia and span the timeframe of about one thousand years. It surveys artistic fields shaped by Hindu-Buddhist ideals. These testify to the creative, technological capacities of designers and communities of artists, as well as the ambitions and resources of patrons. They also reveal links within the region, and connections with India. The module cultivates methods for analysing the composition and formation of images, designs and built forms, gaining understanding of their symbolic import, and fostering insights into complex relationships between religious ideals and their artistic representations.","title":"Art in Southeast Asia, 4th-14th centuries CE","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"AH2101","module_credit":"4","module_code":"AH2204","prereq_tree":"AH2101","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
