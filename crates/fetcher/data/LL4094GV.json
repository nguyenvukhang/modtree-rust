Students will also have an opportunity to \"pitch” their services to various student start-up founders and, where successful, to drafting legal documentation for specific start-up ideas to help turn the student’s start-up ideas into reality. \n\nAdditionally, students will assist NES review contracts to facilitate NES’s partnerships with external organisations \n\nNote: Students who participate in this clinic will record credit for this clinic in AY2021-22 Semester 2. However, due to the nature of the collaboration between NES and CPBCLE and the timeframe of the NES-run module, the work will be spread out over both Semester 1 and Semester 2.","title":"NUS Entrepreneurship Society Collaboration Clinic","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.
