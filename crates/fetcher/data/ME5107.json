{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course introduces the principles of vibration for linear discrete and continuous systems. It will start\nwith the revision of the single degree of freedom spring mass system and then expanded into the study\nof the free and forced vibration of one degree-of-systems and multiple degree-of-freedom-systems\nincluding damping. Major topics includes the natural modes of vibration and the associated eigenvalue\nproblems. Students will aslo be exposed to vibration simulation using SOLIDWORKS. The remaining\ntopics include the vibration of continuous systems such as string, rods and beams and techniques for\nvibration measurement.","title":"Vibration Theory and Applications","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME5107","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.5,1.0,1.5,4.0]}
