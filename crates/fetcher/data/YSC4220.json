{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"YSC3230 Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations","description":"Much of modern science and mathematics is expressed in the language of differential equations. Population models in ecology, financial growth, heat conduction, and water waves are a few examples. In this course, you will solve the classical linear ordinary and partial differential equations.\n\nStudents will assemble a toolbox of mathematical techniques to solve initial and boundary value problems, including integrating factors, separation of variables, and Fourier series.","title":"Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC2232 Linear Algebra and YSC3240 Foundations of Applied Mathematics or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC4220","prereq_tree":{"and":["YSC2232","YSC3240"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,8.5]}
