{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module traces the China-Hong Kong-Singapore connection through film and television in the 20th century. Students will develop an understanding of the socio-political context in which Chinese diasporic communities were established and how the business of film production, distribution and exhibition connected these disparate localities. It will also highlight the symbiotic relationship between filmmaking and the television industry across different countries in East and Southeast Asia, notably between 1980s and 2000s. Students are encouraged to adopt a multi-disciplinary perspective in their critique of various representations of Chinese Diaspora on film and television and the mass media in general.","title":"Chinese Diaspora and Mass Media in the 20th Century","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CHC5339","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,5,5]}
