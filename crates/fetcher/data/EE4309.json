{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module aims to introduce the robotic senses that support natural interactions between humans and robots and enable robots to navigate in a human living environment.  It examines the principles of robotic auditory system, spoken dialogue system, robotic vision system, and laser imaging system.  It will study the strategy to integrate the robotic perceptual abilities to address real world problems, such as visual language grounding, and 3D semantic maps.","title":"Robot Perception","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"EE4704 \"Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing\" or EE3731C “Signal Processing Methods”, or equivalent.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE4309","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["EE4704","EE3731C"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.0,0.5,2.5,4.0]}
