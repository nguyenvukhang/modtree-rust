{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EE5934, EE6934","description":"Deep learning(DL) refers to machine learning methods based on deep neural networks to learn data representation and perform learning tasks. This course provides an introduction to deep learning and focuses more on applications of DL for digitalization technologies. Students will learn the basic theories, models, algorithms, and recent progress in DL and obtain empirical experience on practical design and applications. The course starts with classical neural network models, followed by deep convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, and applications to computer vision, speech recognition, healthcare and robotics.","title":"Deep Learning for Digitalization Technologies","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"• University level calculus, linear algebra\n• Probability and statistics (e.g. EE2012)\n• Scientific programming language, such as Python (e.g. IT1007).\nAll class assignments will be in Python (and use NumPy).","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5304","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["EE2012","IT1007"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
