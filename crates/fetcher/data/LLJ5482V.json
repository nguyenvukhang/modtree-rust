It examines the international and domestic legal frameworks and principles governing these transitional mechanisms as well as their critique. It studies the many pressing and conflicting needs of post-war societies or societies in transition and how these different needs are captured in transitional mechanisms, such as trials, truth and reconciliation commissions, and reparation schemes. Using Asian case studies (e.g. Timor Leste, Cambodia, Indonesia), this module will explore the challenges faced by societies undergoing political transition and the different measures adopted to address past injustices and facilitate transition.","title":"Transitional Justice in Asia","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"LLJ5482V","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,9.5]}
