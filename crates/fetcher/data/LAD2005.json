{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module provides an understanding of the basic concepts and uses of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology and spatial analysis. GIS is a combination of software and hardware with capabilities for manipulating, analyzing and displaying spatially-referenced information-information which is referenced by its location on the earth's surface. By linking data to maps, GIS reveals relationships not apparent with traditional item-referenced information systems and database management products, and by displaying information in a graphic form, it unpacks complex spatial patterns. The course emphasizes the concepts needed to use GIS correctly and effectively for manipulating, querying, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data.","title":"Introductory GIS for Landscape Architecture","department":"Architecture","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LAD2005","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,2,3,5,0]}
