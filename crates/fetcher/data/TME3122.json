{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"TM2122, ME3122E, ME2143","description":"This course covers the key concepts related to the different modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection and radiation) and principles of heat exchangers. It develops the studentsâ€™ proficiency in applying these heat transfer concepts and principles, to analyse and solve practical engineering problems involving heat transfer processes. Topics include introduction to heat transfer; steady state heat conduction; transient heat conduction; lumped capacitance; introduction to convective heat transfer; external forced convection; internal forced convection; natural/free convection; blackbody radiation and radiative properties; radiative exchange between surfaces; introduction to heat exchangers and basic calculation of overall heat transfer coefficient.","title":"Heat Transfer","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TME3122","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["TME4223","TME4225"],"workload":[3.0,0.5,0.5,1.5,4.5]}
