{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Scientific description of the smallest components of matter (atoms and sub-atomic particles, light) has become known as “quantum theory”. It is one of the greatest triumphs of science it is not a formalisation of evidence and intuition, but rather harnesses phenomena that are invisible to the naked eye and counter-intuitive. It shows how science can stand behind apparently outlandish claims, and put this knowledge to practical use. The “experimental metaphysics” aspect of quantum physics is introduced through the description of paradigmatic phenomena. Then the history and current challenges are presented, with a special focus on the emerging quantum technologies.","title":"The World of Quantum","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"HSI1000 or SP2274 or equivalent, or module(s) approved by host faculty","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HSI2011","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["HSI1000","SP2274"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,2,4]}
