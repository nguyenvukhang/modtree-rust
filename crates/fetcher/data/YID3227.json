{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This class explores religious worldviews and how they are shaped by, and used by humans to shape, earthen ecosystems, past and present. The class adopts an interdisciplinary lens grounded in religion and nature theory to analyze how religious rituals, doctrines, material culture, concepts of the “sacred,” and texts are constructed and performed by humans to make sense of the more-than-human world, while investigating how such religious production is informed and constrained by the environment. It consists of case study analysis, ecological hermeneutics of sacred texts, and exploring leading theoretical approaches to the academic study of religion and the environment.","title":"Religion and the Environment","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YID1201 Introduction to Environmental Studies or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YID3227","prereq_tree":"YID1201","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,7.5]}
