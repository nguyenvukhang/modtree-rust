{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module explores the relationship between work and life. Does work make life fulfilling, or does a fulfilling life take place beyond or apart from work? Is the tension between work and life, albeit deeply entrenched, even necessary? What roles do young people have in shaping new work-life arrangements? We will first examine major transformations in the organization of work and shifting notions of leisure and life in unit one. In unit two, we will consider some possibilities for sustainable lifestyles and the challenges of flexible and alternative work.","title":"Reimagining Work / Life","department":"NUS College","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NHS2054","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,0,0,2,4]}
