{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"In this module students will learn various data-driven machine-learning models and develop essential background needed to apply these models to solve practical pattern recognition and regression problems. It consists of two parts. For Part I, the main topics are: linear networks, single and multilayer Perceptions, radial basis\nfunction networks and self-organizing maps. For Part II, the main topics include: learning in feature space, constrained optimization, kernel-based learning machines (support vector machine learning), and reinforcement learning. This\nmodule is intended for graduate students and engineers interested in various models of learning machine for solving application-oriented problems.","title":"Machine Learning with Applications","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Basics of Linear Algebra and some experience with either MATLAB or Python programming.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5301","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
