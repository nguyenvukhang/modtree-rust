Normally undertaken in the third year of study,\nthis module forms an initial capstone for instrumental\nMajors on the BMus programme, serving otherwise as the\nfinal capstone for those undertaking instrumental studies\nas a second major. The module continues and\nconsolidates processes initiated in previous semesters,\nmanifesting their outcome in a shorter professional level\nperformance of approximately half an hourâ€™s duration\n(usually either a recital and piano-accompanied concerto\nperformance). The performance should demonstrate the\nemerging professional capacities of each student.","title":"Junior Recital","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"MUA2162","module_credit":"6","module_code":"MUA3161","prereq_tree":"MUA2162","fulfill_requirements":["MUA3162"],"workload":[0,3,0,0,12]}
