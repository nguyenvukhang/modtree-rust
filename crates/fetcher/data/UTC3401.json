A CAPT UROP may focus on research  related to a \nparticular aspect of life, education or organization at the College. Alternatively, students may participate in research led by a College Fellow or other academic,  as long as the project gives the student exposure to forms of expertise and/or interests that go beyond any particular discipline. The aim of the UROP is to \nhelp support a studentâ€™s academic and professional development through a meaningful research apprenticeship. The UROP is a graded module.","title":"CAPT Undergraduate Research Opportunity (UROP)","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTC3401","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,8,2]}
