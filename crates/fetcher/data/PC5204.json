{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Spintronics is the study of the intrinsic spin of the electron and its application in spin-logic and devices, spin-polarized injection devices, and storage media.  This is important for a variety of current and emerging applications in magnetic memories.  This course equips students with essential knowledge of magnetism, and exchange interactions in solids; half metals, and dilute magnetic semiconductors; spin injection, transport and detection; and magnetic nanostructures, and their applications in: GMR read-write heads, MRAM, spinFET, spin-torque oscillators.","title":"Magnetism and Spintronics","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC3235, PC4240, and PC4241 or equivalent modules approved by the lecturer or Department Approval","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC5204","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["PC3235","PC4240"]},"PC4241"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
