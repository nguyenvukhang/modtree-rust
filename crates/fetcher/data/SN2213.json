{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"PS2247 South Asia: Politics and Foreign Policy","description":"This module is about the politics of democratization in South Asia, a region with a long history of interstate and intra-state conflict. The post-colonial separation of India into India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh has caused cross border tensions and paved the way for military intervention in the domestic politics of Pakistan and Bangladesh. The diverse interests of ethnic and religious communities are testing the legitimacy of majoritarian democracy and the limits of claims for autonomous government. This module examines the institutional structures, State-citizen relations, and identity politics in South Asiaâ€™s democratic experiments to find hope for democracy in a polarized world.","title":"South Asian Democracies - Violence, Conflict, and Hope","department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SN2213","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,0,7]}
