{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module revisits ideas in analysis from a more abstract point of view, in the settings of metric spaces\nand topological spaces. These abstract notions form the basis for much of modern mathematics, especially\nin geometry and analysis. Main topics: metric spaces, convergence, completeness, contraction mappings,\ntopological spaces, compactness, compact spaces of functions, locally compact spaces.","title":"Metric and Topological Spaces","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA2108 or MA2108S","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MA3209","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["MA2108","MA2108S"]},"fulfill_requirements":["MA4211","MA4266","MA5210","MA4273"],"workload":[3,1,0,0,6]}
