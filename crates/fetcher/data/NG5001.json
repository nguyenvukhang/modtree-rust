{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Designed for all PhD students of the NUS Graduate School (NUSGS), this module facilitates further development of students’ academic literacies in critical reading, writing and oral presentation. For critical reading, students will be guided to deconstruct and evaluate arguments – competences which students will then deploy by writing a proposal. In writing the proposal, students will need to demonstrate the ability to use suitable academic conventions. This proposal will subsequently be delivered as an oral presentation to a cross-disciplinary audience. This module utilizes a blended learning approach, where students’ learning experiences will comprise in-class and online synchronous and asynchronous lessons and activities.Academic Communication for Graduate Researchers","title":"Academic Communication for Graduate Researchers","department":"NUSGS Dean’s Office","faculty":"NUS Graduate School","prerequisite":"ES5000 and ES5001A (if students are required to take these modules)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NG5001","prereq_tree":{"and":["ES5000","ES5001A"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,3,0,0,4]}
