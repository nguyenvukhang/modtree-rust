{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EE6104 Adaptive Control Systems (Advanced)","description":"The course aims to introduce the basic concepts and design methods of adaptive control. The concepts underlying adaptive control schemes, such as Lyapunov-based direct adaptive control scheme, self-tuning regulator and model reference adaptive control, will be studied in detail. Least squares estimate and the issues related to parameter adaptation will also be introduced. To provide an understanding of an alternative to \"adaptation\", the concept and basic design of variable structure control will be discussed. Case studies of various engineering control problems will be used throughout the course to provide insights and useful design guideline.","title":"Adaptive Control Systems","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"[applicable to UG level students only] Requires EE3331C or EE5101/ME5401; or\n\n[applicable to GD level students only] Requires EE5101/EE5101R/ME4501 Linear Systems as a pre-requisite or co-requisite; or background knowledge in linear system or with  permission by lecturer.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE5104","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["EE3331C","EE5101","ME5401","EE5101R","ME4501"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
