{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module gives an introduction of sensors and sensing systems. Systems involving multiple sensors and components are co-designed and optimized to realize functions which provide new sensing methodology in a wide-range applications, e.g., industry 4.0, environment monitoring, healthcare and rehabilitation, etc. By having sensors as building blocks, students will explore smart systems realized with the aid of big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing in the 5G era. Case studies in labs will help students acquire knowledge and skills in using sensors for making smart systems for real world applications.","title":"Smart Sensing Systems","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Knowledge of basic electronic circuits and common electronic components like PN junctions, BJTs, MOSFETs, diodes and operational amplifiers.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5204","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,2,2,4]}
