{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MA1102R Calculus or MA1505 Mathematics I or MA1511 Engineering Calculus or MA1521 Calculus for Computing","description":"Calculus unites the study of instantaneous rates of change, area and optimisation, via the mathematical concepts of limit and infinity. This module provides a conceptual framework for Calculus. We eschew full mathematical rigour, but emphasise real world phenomena more than the rote formal calculations that make up a typical high school Calculus class.\n\nThis module is suitable not only for those who have never learned Calculus before, but also for those who have completed a high school Calculus course. Students completing the module will be prepared for discipline-specific classes in the Sciences and Social Sciences which make use of Calculus.","title":"Calculus","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC1216","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["YSC2203","YSC1213","YSC2232","YSC2243","YSC2252"],"workload":[0.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,5.5]}
