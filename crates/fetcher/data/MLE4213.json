{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module provides an introduction on the innovation & product development processes that materials scientists and engineers are likely to face in their future workplaces. This course will be conducted with a mixture of MSE relevant case-studies and experiential group learning. Students will start from the pre-development process: building up their problem statements, ideation and developing their minimum viable product (product concept) by considering the technical feasibility, business viability as well as customer desirability; and then followed by development and manufacturing processes: i.e. samples development, test & certification, production etc. Continuous improvement upon product development will also be introduced.","title":"Innovation & Product Development for Material Engineers","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"MLE2104 Mechanical Properties of Materials","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MLE4213","prereq_tree":"MLE2104","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,2,5]}
