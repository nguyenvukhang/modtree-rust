{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Advanced inorganic electronic materials have attracted a lot of interest recently for their unique electronic, mechanical, optical, thermal and chemical properties, and potential applications in future devices. This module covers the theory, synthesis & processing, structure-property relationships, applications and current frontiers, of the four main families of 2D materials: (i) graphene and related materials; (ii) transition-metal dichalcogenides; and (iii) perovskites. Learners will gain the advanced knowledge needed to guide the further development or deployment of these materials in advanced manufacturing, especially in electronics.","title":"Advanced Inorganic Electronic Materials","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CM5263","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
