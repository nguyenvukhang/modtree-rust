{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GEH1018, GEK1539","description":"This module is intended for all CHS students interested in the way the natural sciences (physics, mathematics and chemistry) did progress through the ages, and the cultural background and impact of these developments. The main focus will not be solely on the triumphs of science: As much as looking at success stories, we will also examine cases when things went wrong and try to learn about the reasons and conditions that lead to such problematic situations. We will examine how progress depends critically not only on conditions within the scientific communities but also on wider societal, economic and cultural influences.","title":"A Brief History of Science & Why Things Often Go Wrong","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"HSI1000 or SP2274 or equivalent, or module(s) approved by host faculty","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HSI2008","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["HSI1000","SP2274"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,2,6]}
