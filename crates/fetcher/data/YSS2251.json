{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This seminar is an interdisciplinary, comparative exploration of how race makes space and how space makes race in US and global contexts. We will explore these relationships through historical and contemporary case studies, with attention to how geographies of white supremacy and settler/colonial power seek to erase or subsume the spatial practices of certain groups of people. Because we take a comparative approach, the cases selected are sited in various locations in Africa, the Americas, and Europe.","title":"Race, Space, Power Mapping the Global Colour Line","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS2251","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,6.5,6.0]}
