{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Students will work in teams of 4 or 5 to solve real-world problems, from idea to innovative prototype solutions, in semester 1. Each student will be supervised by several faculty members, one host supervisor who instructs the student on certain specialised techniques, while other supervisors help in the application of these techniques to the specific design projects being carried out. Design project examples are the solar-powered golf buggy and a nanodevice. The project may be structured in such a way that it can be continued in the module ESP3903 Major Design Project II which will be run in semester 2.","title":"Major Design Project I","department":"Engineering Science Programme","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"This module is open only to students enrolled in the Engineering Science programme (ESP)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ESP3902","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,8,0]}
