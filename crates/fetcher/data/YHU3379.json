{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Is, as is popularly supposed, man a ‘rational animal’? Since the ‘animality’ of man is uncontroversial, this course investigates whether he is rational. Towards this end, we first consider what the proper domain of rationality is. Is rationality a property of the goals we have, or of the means we employ to achieve those goals? Or, is rationality best conceived as a property of our beliefs? In either case, we question what constitutes this property of rationality. We then discuss Bayesianism – the industry standard for rationality – before reviewing, in its light, the empirical evidence on the rationality of man.","title":"The Nature of Rationality","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3379","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.5,6.0]}
