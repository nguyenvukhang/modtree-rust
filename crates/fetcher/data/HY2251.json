{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module explores the role of technology in human history from Ancient times until today.  Does technology drive history, or is it the other way around?  Examining a variety of important technologies - ships, windmills, telephones, and of course wheels and the internet - the course will follow a different path through time than that commonly taken.  We?ll not forget politics or society, however, because 'technology' turns out to be as much about people as hardware. Wars, geopolitics, and the discovery of new pleasures and anxieties are all interwoven with the history of tools and techniques.  The module is open to students from any faculty.","title":"From the Wheel to the Web","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HY2251","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,0,7]}
