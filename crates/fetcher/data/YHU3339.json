{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"When Rome grew into a world empire, the city of Rome transformed into the caput mundi, the capital world. It was the first – and until London in 1811 – the only Western city to reach a population of a million. Rome reflected the grandeur and diversity of its empire. It was a cosmopolitan, multi-lingual, and multi-ethnic mega-city, which show-cased Roman might, organizational efficiency, and wealth through public works, monumental architecture, and a consumer culture that large swaths of the population could indulge in. The course will deal with the management of a pre-industrial metropolis and its political, cultural, social and economic life.","title":"Rome in Antiquity","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
