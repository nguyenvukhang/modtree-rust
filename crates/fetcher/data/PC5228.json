{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module provides an introduction to quantum information and quantum computation. In addition to physics majors, the course addresses students with a good background in discrete mathematics or computer science.The following topics will be covered: (1) Introduction: a brief review of basic notions of information science (Shannon entropy, channel capacity) and of basic quantum kinematics with emphasis on the description of multi-qubit systems and their discrete dynamics. (2) Quantum information: Entanglement and its numerical measures, separability of multi-partite states, quantum channels, standard protocols for quantum cryptography and entanglement purification, physical implementations. And (3) Quantum computation: single-qubit gates, two-qubit gates and their physical realization in optical networks, ion traps, quantum dots, Universality theorem, quantum networks and their design, simple quantum algorithms (Jozsa-Deutsch decision algorithm, Grover search algorithm, Shor factorization algorithm).\nThe module is tightly integrated with IBM quantum computer hands-on experience via IBM Q Experience cloud services. Students will learn fundamentals of Qiskit, a modern and rapidly developing quantum computer programming language, by directly implementing concepts learnt in the classroom.","title":"Quantum Information and Computation","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC3130 or Departmental Approval","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC5228","prereq_tree":"PC3130","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
