{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This non-technical module uses theatre to explore two sides of Artificial Intelligence. First, we consider how theatre makers are using the creative potential of AI in their work (for example, by using robots, computational choreographic scores and immersive environments generated by deep learning). Second, we review theatre performances aimed at critiquing the ethical, societal and epistemological challenges brought forth by AI (for example, the racial biases in face recognition and the ecological costs of the servers required for deep learning).","title":"Theatre, Big Data and Artificial Intelligence","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"TS1101E","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TS2244","prereq_tree":"TS1101E","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,0,7]}
