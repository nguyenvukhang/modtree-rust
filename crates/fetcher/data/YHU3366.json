{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"In between China, India, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam lies an expansive region of mountains and valleys populated for centuries by hill peoples, scattered townsfolk, fugitives, bandits, and insurgents. Through a range of historical, ethnographic, and personal accounts, this course puts these often-marginalized figures at the center. We look over their shoulders as they engaged or avoided the “empires” all around imperial China and Vietnam, British and French colonial regimes, and modern nation states of all kinds. At the same time, we also study the efforts of state actors to capture, control, convert, aid, and “civilize” the peoples of the borderlands.","title":"Edge of Empires: The China-Southeast Asia Borderlands","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3366","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,8.5]}
