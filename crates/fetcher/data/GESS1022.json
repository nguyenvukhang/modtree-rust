{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GES1031","description":"This module introduces students to concepts in culture and communication in multiracial Singapore. It raises fundamental questions around what communication means, how it is practiced and enacted (disseminated, practised, consumed) in Singapore. In doing so, it considers the institutions, the history and the lens that we bring to understanding culture and communication, and how they in turn impact on our society. By understanding key sites of Singaporean culture, from hawker centres to shopping, this module asks how we may practice communication as citizens, consumers, and creators in a hyper-urban landscape that positions Singaporeans as global consumers and local citizens.","title":"Culture and Communication in Singapore","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GESS1022","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,7,0]}
