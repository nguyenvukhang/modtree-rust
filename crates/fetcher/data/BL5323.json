{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Spatial data management and analysis are essential to support environmental sustainability interventions. Information on carbon stocks distribution, biodiversity,\nland-use change and opportunity costs help devise, monitor and assess the effectiveness of conservation and nature-based climate solutions interventions.\nEnvironmental sustainability practitioners that are able to handle and analyse large quantities of spatial data generated by remote sensing and social media are in high\ndemand, especially towards the monitoring and verification of carbon credits. To fill this demand gap, the module trains students in the integration of spatial programming skills, remote sensing and geographic information systems to answer environmental sustainability questions.","title":"Spatial modelling for environmental sustainability","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BL5323","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,0,6]}
