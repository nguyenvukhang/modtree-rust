Through a group creative project, students are challenged to make their own Singapore film that involves the practical application of critical ideas and enables students to participate in the ways that a national cinema performs and functions. The films studied may involve mature content and have varied film ratings.","title":"Singapore Film: Performance of Identity","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GESS1021","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,0,7]}
