{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module surveys how societies gain new understandings of the past through performances in the public sphere. A broad spectrum of performances across various cultural contexts will be explored, including theatre and dance, historical re-enactments, public rituals, immersive exhibitions, films, and digital sites such as video games and social media. This module equips students with a toolkit with which to interpret, analyse, and reflect on the dramaturgical strategies and techniques that shape the stories told in these performances, examining how they enhance historical consciousness and negotiate the distance between past and present for the communities involved.","title":"Theatres of Memory: Performing Public History","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HY5415","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
