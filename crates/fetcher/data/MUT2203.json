{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module explores common textures found in music, such as monophony, homophony, polyphony and heterophony, and examines the influence of textural and timbral elements on a workâ€™s overall shape and character.\n\nThe module also includes an introduction to basic orchestration techniques. Students will examine different combination of instruments in various textural settings, write for combinations of instruments with attention to timbre, range, performance techniques and instrumental idioms.
