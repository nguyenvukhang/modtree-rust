{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module will explore the cognitive processes that underlie learning in educational contexts. We will examine (i) the factors that influence effective encoding, organisation, and subsequent retrieval of knowledge, (ii) how learners monitor and regulate their learning, and (iii) how expertise is acquired. We will also delve into the scientific literature to evaluate the effectiveness of various study/instructional strategies, and compare the research findings against our own intuitions (i.e., how we learn best may not correspond to how we think we learn best). We will consider the implications of cognitive science research for enhancing educational practice.","title":"Applying Cognitive Psychology to Learning & Instruction","department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs of which student must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132 and 4 out of the 5 core modules (PL3232/PL3102 â€“ PL3236/PL3106), in which one must be PL3233/PL3103, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"PL4880L","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,7.5]}
