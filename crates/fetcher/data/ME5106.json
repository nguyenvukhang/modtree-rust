{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Acoustic engineering is the branch of engineering dealing with sound and vibration, typically including the design, analysis and control of sound, such as acoustic designs in building and marine structures, and acoustic signal analysis in industrial detections, and noise controls in daily life. This course will cover various aspects of acoustics: the basic fundamentals of acoustics, noise sources, control and mitigation, acoustic design in building and marine structures, modeling and simulation of acoustics, acounstic monitoring in 3D printing processes. The emphasis will be on the physical pictures and real-life applications particularly in cutting-edge techniques rather than mathematical.","title":"Engineering Acoustics","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME5106","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
