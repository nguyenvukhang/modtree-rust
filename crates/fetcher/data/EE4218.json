{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module deals with the design of systems with close integration between hardware and software, a main characteristic of IoT systems. There is an emphasis on the design of custom hardware accelerators/hardware-software co-design, which can reduce the amount of data (and hence the power) required to be communicated through the network from an IoT node, while keeping the power requirement for computations at an acceptable level. Students will learn the design of such systems through HDLs and high-level languages. The project involves collecting sensory data (real or simulated) and processing it using custom accelerators.","title":"Embedded Hardware System Design","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"EE2028 or CG2028 (for AY2017 intake & after) ; EE2024 (for AY2016 intake & prior)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE4218","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["EE5902","EE5903","EE6231"],"workload":[2.0,0.5,1.0,3.0,3.5]}
