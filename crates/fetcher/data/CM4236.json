{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces the fundamental concepts and techniques from physical chemistry that are most relevant to life sciences, and apply them to a variety of biomolecular systems. In addition to important tools from optical spectroscopy and imaging (including absorption, fluorescence, FCS, FRET, FRAP, single-molecule and super-resolution microscopy), this module will also cover key principles in macromolecular binding equilibria and cooperativity, molecular diffusion, biochemical kinetics, and statistical and stochastic approaches in biophysical chemistry. These concepts and techniques will be illustrated with a wide selection of examples ranging from enzyme catalysis to protein folding, and from molecular motors to gene expression.","title":"Spectroscopy & Imaging in Biophysical Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM2101 Physical Chemistry 2","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CM4236","prereq_tree":"CM2101","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,3,3]}
