{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This seminar will discuss some of the 20th Century’s most prominent thinkers’ interpretation of what political philosophy is, and what it should be. Readings by Karl Popper, Isaiah Berlin, Leo Strauss, Michel Foucault, and Jurgen Habermas.  A common thread among the thinkers we will be covering is a disenchantment with the philosophic tradition and the “isms” -- from Liberalism to Marxism to Nihilism -- to which it led. In this seminar we will examine their assessment of humankind's political situation in the wake of the Second World War, as well as evaluate their proposed alternatives.","title":"Political Philosophy after World War II","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS3351","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,9.5]}
