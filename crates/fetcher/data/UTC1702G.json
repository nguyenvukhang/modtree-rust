What role do markets play in underpinning the global phenomenon of rising social and economic inequality in the past decades? What are the consequences of inequality? What can be done to curb inequality in a market society? Students will approach such questions from a holistic perspective, emphasizing the interconnections and interdependencies between consumers and firms, workers and employers, investors and policy-makers.
