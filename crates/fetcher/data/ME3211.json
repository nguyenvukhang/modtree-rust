{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module covers topics on: Linear elasticity in which the general equations of equilibrium and compatibility are derived and its applications are illustrated for complex problems; Unsymmetrical bending of beams; Stresses in pressurized thick-walled cylinders in elastic and elasto-plastic regions; Stresses in rotating members; Introduction to mechanics of composite materials; and Experimental stress analysis with particular emphasis on optical methods. This is an elective module and is intended for students in Stage 3 and 4 who have an interest in the stress analysis of isotropic and composite materials. The materials in this module are applicable to chemical, civil, mechanical and aeronautical engineering.","title":"Mechanics Of Solids","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"ME2112","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME3211","prereq_tree":"ME2112","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.5,0.0,2.0,4.5]}
