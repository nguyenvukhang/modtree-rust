Understanding how to use and analyse it is the most critical skill of the 21st century. Particularly for the environment, which brings together a multitude of complex systems and phenomena, we need to be equipped to derive clear signals from oceans of noise and from vast amounts of data that are being generated on a daily basis to underpin sound policy choices and scientific inquiry.
