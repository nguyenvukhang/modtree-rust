Students will be encouraged to work as an intern at local broadcasting units, production house or in an approved sound related business. Students will need to work at least 10 hours per week. The feedback of the intern company will largely determine the studentâ€™s grade in the module. The student will also be graded based on an essay detailing the valuable experiences which the student has gained from the practice.","title":"Internship in Audio Arts and Science 2","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"4th year standing","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MUA4180","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,10,0]}
