{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This graduate seminar examines changes in family behaviour and household relationships from a global perspective. Class discussion will consider major theoretical perspectives and debates about changing family forms and family variation around the world. Literature will be drawn from multiple disciplines to explain these changes. This course will stress the dynamic interaction between macrosocietal forces and the microsocietal forces that affect family memberâ€™s lives around the world. We will study how the forms, functions, and definitions of the family vary across historical and cultural contexts and how social class, gender, and racial inequalities affect family changes.","title":"Families in Transition","department":"Sociology and Anthropology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SC6213","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,4,3]}
