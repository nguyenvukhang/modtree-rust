{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"Not applicable to USP modules.","description":"This module primarily introduces fundamental skills of writing that are appropriate to the interdisciplinary context of the USP. It does so by advancing various topical questions surrounding our fascination with and anxieties about the portentous and cataclysmic events leading to the end of world. Are these concerns new or culturally specific? Are these apocalyptic visions obsessed with finality or are they genuinely more interested in new beginnings? In exploring these topics, students develop skills necessary in reading primary and secondary texts, to ask focused questions and explain why they matter, and ultimately to respond with well-formed arguments.","title":"Apocalyptic Cultures","department":"NUS College Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS College","prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP modules.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NTW2007","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,4,0,3,3]}
