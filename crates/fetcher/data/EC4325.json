Given such businesses are based on network effects and data, these businesses raise many new economic and strategic questions that policymakers and market participants are currently grappling with, and which our standard economic analysis does not properly address. The module will develop industrial organization models of multi-sided platforms to explore interesting strategy and economic policy questions specific to these platforms.","title":"The Economics of Digital Platforms","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in EC, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.
