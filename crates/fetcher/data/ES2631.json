Students will be introduced to a reasoning in engineering framework (Paul et al., 2019), as well as key principles of effective communication in the field of engineering, such as being purpose- and context-conscious and audience-centric (Irish & Weiss, 2013). These will be applied to analyze engineering ideas in both written and oral communication. Students will also engage in a group engineering conceptual design project aimed at promoting critical analysis and communication within groups.","title":"Critique and Communication of Thinking and Design","department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"Students who are required to take ES1000 Foundation Academic English and/or ES1103 English for Academic Purposes must pass the modules before they are allowed to read this module","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ES2631","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["ES1000","ES1103"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1.5,2.0,0.0,4.0,2.5]}
