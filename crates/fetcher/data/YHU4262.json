{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The seventh century in India was a time of intense philosophical development. Buddhist philosophers and Vedic-affirming brahminical philosophers constructed sophisticated theories to account for our experience of the world, our communicative abilities, and our ability to know. Kumārila Bhaṭṭa was a powerful proponent of brahminical thought. This course will focus on his engagement with Buddhist thinkers, in particular Dignāga (rumor has it he studied in a monastary to learn how to defeat them!). We will focus on topics in epistemology and language as well as their implications for what kind of beings we are, and how we should live.","title":"Buddhists and Brahmins: Kumārila Bhaṭṭa and Dignāga","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Completion of all first year Common Curriculum modules.
