{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"DSC3221, IE3110E","description":"This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modelling techniques, random number generators, discrete event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyse and develop simulation models of given problems.","title":"Simulation","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"TIE3110","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,1.0,0.5,4.0,4.0]}
