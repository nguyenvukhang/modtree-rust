This module\nprovides a graduate level introduction to the two related fields, with equal emphasis on both. Key topics for the first part include: fundamentals of probability and inference, hierarchical modellin g, model validation and comparison, and Monte Carlo methods; for the second part, they include: classification and regression, kernel methods, variational methods, and neural networks. The module will be largely theoretically oriented, with the occasional computational component.","title":"Bayesian Statistics and Machine Learning","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Departmental approval","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC5252","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
