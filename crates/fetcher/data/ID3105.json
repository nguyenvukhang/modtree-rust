{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module reinforces Design Platforms 1 through exercises of higher complexity. This is a “vertical studio” based design platform. Senior and junior students will participate in design projects which encourage cross-pollination of thoughts, skills and learning. The students will play the role of a junior designer and work together with the senior students from ID 4105 in the same platform. The objectives are to enable students to explore strategic design innovation through a simulated real studio environment. In this platform, students can select either conceptual or real-life projects led by our industry collaborators and relevant experts within the division.","title":"Design Platforms 2","department":"Industrial Design","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Pass ID 2105 & 2106","module_credit":"10","module_code":"ID3105","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["ID4106"],"workload":[2,6,0,17,6]}
