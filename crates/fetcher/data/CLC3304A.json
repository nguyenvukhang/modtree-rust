{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"How does life in a city affect our sense of community? Presently, more than half of the world’s communities live in cities. Our experience of community and society is, therefore, often tied to the various spaces that people encounter and live within the confines of a city. Adopting an interdisciplinary perspective that blends theoretical insight with contextual realities, this module examines the complex relationship between urban settings in a city and the communities that co-exist within it. Particular attention on the social-cultural dimensions that influence a person’s lived experience will be explored as part of integration and engagement issues within a community. This will be complemented by case studies in Singapore and beyond whenever relevant, providing a grounded and comparative approach to understanding the challenges faced in the task of sustainable community development in urban settings.","title":"City, Culture and Community","department":"Chua Thian Poh Comm Leader Center","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CLC3304A","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
