{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module aims to provide an opportunity for the students to learn commonly-used network protocols in greater technical depth with their implementation details than a basic networking course. Students will perform hands-on experiments in configuring and interconnecting LANs using networking devices/technologies (e.g., routers, switches, SDN switches, and hubs), networking protocols (e.g., DHCP, DNS, RIP, OSPF, ICMP, TCP, UDP, wireless LAN, VLAN protocols, SIP, SSL, IPSec-VPN) and networking tools (e.g, tcpdump, netstat, ping, traceroute). Students will learn higher-layer network protocols and develop network applications (client/server, P2P) via socket programming.","title":"Computer Networks Practice","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS2105 or EE3204/E or EE4204","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS3103","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["CS2105","EE3204","EE3204E","EE4204"]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS4344"],"workload":[2,0,2,4,2]}
