{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module examines the impact of feminism on human geography, from the call to insert women into geographical analyses and take into account gender relations in rethinking dominant definitions of space, place, landscape and nature to more recent debates on diversity and difference.  It also explores the politics and practice of doing feminist research in geography.  Drawing on case studies in both developed and developing countries, the gendering of specific sites (ranging from the home to the nation) and processes (e.g. migration) is explicated in the module. The module is targeted at all students interested in gender issues.","title":"Gender, Space & Place","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GE3206","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
