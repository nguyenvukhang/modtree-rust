{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EE3103 Communications","description":"This is an introductory course on analog and digital communication systems. It starts with an overview of analog and digital communications. Analog communication techniques such as amplitude modulation and frequency modulation are studied. The advantages of digital over analog communications in the presence of noise are discussed. Next, pulse coded modulation and waveform quantization techniques are discussed as the bridge from analog to digital communications. The communications channel and limits of communications (e.g., Shannon's coding theorem) are also presented. Next various digital modulation techniques such as phase shift keying and quadrature amplitude modulation are covered. Source coding techniques for data compression, including fixed and variable length codes, are presented. Then, channel coding techniques for error detection and error correction are covered. We wrap the course with an introduction to communication networks.","title":"Communication Systems","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"EE2023 Signals & Systems","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE3131C","prereq_tree":"EE2023","fulfill_requirements":["EE4114"],"workload":[2.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,6.0]}
