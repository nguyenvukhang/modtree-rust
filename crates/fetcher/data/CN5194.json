{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The link between global warming and rising anthropogenic CO2 in the atmosphere is now well recognized. The urgency to address this existential threat requires a multipronged approach where carbon capture, concentration, sequestration and utilization are among the leading mitigation options. This module provides a broad introduction to global warming and an overview of various intervention strategies. Various carbon capture and concentration technologies, and sequestration options are discussed in detail. The challenges and opportunities of CO2 utilization for chemicals production are addressed. Renewable and low CO2 emission alternative energy technology options are also discussed.","title":"Carbon Capture Sequestration and Utilization","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Familiar with general knowledge of chemistry and chemical engineering.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN5194","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,2,5]}
