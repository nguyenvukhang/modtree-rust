{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module takes an in-depth look at the acquisition and extinction of phobias from an experimental psychopathology framework. It also examines how and why fears relapse after successful exposure therapy and how to reduce return of fear (ie, recovery from extinction effects). These topics are investigated within the context of fear conditioning with the translational focus on phobias and other anxiety disorders. This class will discuss the biological and theoretical mechanisms of these phenomena, and the research that has investigated these topics. Animal and human research from associative learning, experimental psychopathology, cognitive, and behavioral neuroscience will guide the discussions.","title":"Application of Psychology to Fears and Phobias","department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs of which student must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132, and 4 of the 5 core modules (PL3232/PL3102-PL3236/PL3106) which should include PL3232/PL3102, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.
