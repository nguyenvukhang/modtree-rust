{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EE5907","description":"The main objectives of this graduate module are to equip\nstudents with the fundamentals of statistical pattern\nrecognition (SPR) algorithms and techniques. PR deals\nwith automated classification, identification, and/or\ncharacterisations of signals/data from various sources.\nBecause real world data is noisy and uncertain, we will\nfocus on SPR techniques, with particular emphasis on the\ntheoretical foundations of various techniques. Topics\ncovered include: fundamentals of parameter estimation\n(maximum likelihood, maximum-a-posteriori, posterior\npredictive), supervised learning, generative models, naive\nBayes, discriminative models, logistic regression, nonparametric\ntechniques, Bayesian decision theory.","title":"Statistical Pattern Recognition","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"This course assumes students have taken an undergraduate probability/statistics course, an undergraduate programming course and have at least a basic linear algebra background, all of which should be covered in a typical electrical engineering or computer science undergraduate program.","module_credit":"2","module_code":"EE5027","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,2,5]}
