{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"ME3291","description":"This module is a continuation of MA2213 Numerical Analysis I. It introduces and\nanalyzes important numerical methods for solving linear and nonlinear systems,\ntwo-point boundary value problems, as well as Monte Carlo methods and their\napplications in such fields as quantitative finance and physics. The module aims at\ndeveloping studentsâ€™ problem-solving skills in emerging applications of modern\nscientific computing, and is intended for mathematics and quantitative finance\nmajors and students from engineering, computer science and physical sciences.\nMajor topics: Iterative methods for systems of linear equations and their\nconvergence analysis, numerical solutions of systems of nonlinear equations,\nmethods for solving two-point boundary value problems, Monte Carlo methods\nand their applications.","title":"Numerical Analysis II","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(MA2213 or DSA2102) and (MA1104 or MA2104 or MA1505 or MA1506 or\nMA1507 or MA1511 or MA2311) and (MA2116 or MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MA3227","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["MA2213","DSA2102"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1104","MA2104","MA1505","MA1506","MA1507","MA1511","MA2311"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA2116","MA2216","ST2131","ST2334"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,3,3]}
