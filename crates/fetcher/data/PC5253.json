{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Much of our real world data are manifestations or measurements of their underlying complex interactions. Hence, modelling and analysis of the underlying complex systems can reveal understandings and predictions that complement black-box machine learning tools. This module will cover the basic concepts and tools in analysing complex systems and simulation models, and more importantly why and when we need such white-box tools derived from statistical physics. Certain key concepts in complexity science will be intrudcued. It will also provide hands-on experience with system analysis and simulation modelling in Python.","title":"Complex Systems Analysis and Modelling","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Departmental approval","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC5253","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
