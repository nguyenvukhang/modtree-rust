{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CN3101 - Chemical Engineering Process Lab I\nCN3102 - Chemical Engineering Process Lab II","description":"Students will learn how to perform laboratory-scale experiments in a small team. This practical module strengthens their technical writing and oral presentation, and problem-solving skills. Experiments in this module are related to chemical engineering thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, reaction engineering, process dynamics and control, mass transfer and separation processes. Moreover, students will learn how to use safety equipment to handle hazardous waste following safety protocols. They will also learn assembly/disassembly of equipment, fault diagnosis, operation of thermocouples and flow meters, instrumental analysis, data logging and processing, operation of process plant items, error analysis and data validation.","title":"Chemical Engineering Process Lab","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"CN2121 - Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN2122A - Fluid Mechanics\nCN2116 - Chemical Kinetics & Reactor Design\nCN2125 - Heat and Mass Transfer\nCN3124A - Fluid-Particle Systems","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN3101A","prereq_tree":{"and":["CN2121","CN2122A","CN2116","CN2125","CN3124A"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,5,1,4]}
