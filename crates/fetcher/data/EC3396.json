Why is\nit occasionally good to breach a contract?” These questions touch very distinct areas of the law. But\nthere is one way to go about answering all of them: Economic Analysis! In this class we will show that\neconomic efficiency is what makes a good law and that laws that don’t make sense can be critiqued with\neconomic arguments. Law and economics is a class that expands the scope of economics and limits the\narbitrariness of the law.","title":"Economic Analysis of Law I","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"EC2101","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EC3396","prereq_tree":"EC2101","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
