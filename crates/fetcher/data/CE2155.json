{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"TCE2155","description":"This module equips students with knowledge and skills in structural mechanics, and materials for structural engineering. The topics introduce the fundamentals of material constitutive behaviours and failure models to appreciate the use of materials in structural design. The topics also cover the composite, micro-structure and properties of concrete, steel and wood, with an emphasis on the mix-design of concrete. The module is compulsory for civil engineering undergraduate students without which he will not be qualified to practise as a professional civil engineer.","title":"Principles of Structural Mechanics and Materials","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"CE1103 Principles of Structural and Geotechnical Engineering","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CE2155","prereq_tree":"CE1103","fulfill_requirements":["CE5513","CE5514","CE5604","OT5202","CE3155","CE3166","CE3155A","CE3155B"],"workload":[3.0,1.0,0.5,0.5,5.0]}
