{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"ME2151 Principles of Mechanical Engineering Materials\nME3251 Materials for Engineers","description":"This module equips students with knowledge on the unique properties of materials useful in engineering design selection. Commonly used materials in different engineering designs and emerging materials and processes, and life cycle assessment will be taught. Concepts on surface engineering, strengthening and hardening techniques, hardenability, heat treatment, friction and wear properties will be provided. Key material properties and testing such as tensile testing, compression testing, torsion test, 3-point bending test will be introduced along with their specific relevance. Finally, students will be introduced to the different ways of degradation of materials when it reacts with environment.","title":"Materials for Mechanical Engineering","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME3252","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,3,3]}
