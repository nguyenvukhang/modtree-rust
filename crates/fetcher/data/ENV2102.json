{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module will first introduce students to Environmental Law, particularly conservation and pollution laws, and how these are passed and implemented at the international, regional (ASEAN) and national (Singapore) levels. It will emphasise that laws alone will not help in ensuring the quality of a countryâ€™s environment and the health of its citizens. Laws must be enforced, and the rule of law respected. Good governance is therefore a necessary component of sound environmental management. This module will next examine what constitutes good environmental governance. It will explore environmental and economic policies and how best to resolve the tensions between conservation and development. It will study the setting up of effective administrative institutions, land use planning, the provision of environmental infrastructure (modern sanitation, water treatment plants, transport systems, etc). It will then critically examine the workings of the main administrative agencies that are responsible for environmental management in Singapore. It will also look into the work of local and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) as well as multi-national corporations and corporate social responsibility in Singapore. Comparisons will be made with the administrative and legal systems in other jurisdictions. This module will be taught by staff members from the Law Faculty as well as the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.","title":"Environmental Law","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"For students in the Environmental Studies Programme.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ENV2102","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,0,7]}
