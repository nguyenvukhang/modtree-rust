{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces modern day hardware computing technologies that are capable of handling large-scale data processing. Students are taught how an underlying architecture of a computing platform will look like through systematic case studies on these platforms. Students will learn hardware aspects of a CPU and GPU elements and will work on a few real-world application problems involving machine learning and big data processing. Module also covers certain important concepts under loosely-coupled systems. Students will have hands-on experience in using the public Clouds such as, AWS, Azure, etc., and design specific data pipelines necessary.","title":"Hardware Technologies, Principles, & Platforms","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Software implementation skills using python, R, C, or C++,\nVerilog/VHDL programming knowledge is mandatory, if the project chosen is on FPGA hardware. Basic knowledge on CPU workings using any assembly language is an added asset.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5201","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
