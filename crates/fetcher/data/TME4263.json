How the data between the manufacturing systems are transferred, their standard protocols are also covered. In addition the following topics are covered: Concepts of discrete-event modelling and simulation, definitions, types, essential elements in modelling, design and implementation of  manufacturing simulation models, petri-nets, model verification and validation, input information collection and analysis, interpretation of outputs, use of random inputs and variance reduction techniques, protocol standards, communication topology, MAP/TOP.","title":"Manufact'G Simulat'N & Data Communicat'N","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"TME3162, ME3162, ME3162E, TME2162, TM2162, ME2162E","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TME4263","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["TME3162","ME3162","ME3162E","TME2162","TM2162","ME2162E"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,2.5]}
