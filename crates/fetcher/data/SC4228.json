{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"What is violence? How is violence materialized, contested and reproduced? What can anthropology offer to understandings of violence? Exploring  phenomena ranging from war, genocide and terrorism to domestic abuse, poverty and crime, this course examines violence as a domain of cultural understanding and a mode of social action. Involving both overt and\nspectacular expressions and implicit and everyday forms, our understandings of violence will span the intimacy of the family, the nationalisms of states and the economics of global corporations. Through the comparison of cross-cultural ethnographies, we look critically at the theoretical, empirical, methodological and ethical implications of analysing violence.","title":"Making Sense of Violence","department":"Sociology and Anthropology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC or 28 MCs in GL or GL recognised non-language modules with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"SC4228","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,7.25]}
