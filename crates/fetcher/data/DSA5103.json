{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MA5268 Theory and Algorithms for Nonlinear Optimization","description":"Data-driven machine learning inference is usually modelled as optimization problems in data science. This module covers basic optimization algorithms that are frequently used for solving data-driven inference problems and training deep learning models. The topics include the first and second order methods, stochastic gradient approaches, dynamic programming, structured-matrix factorization. Case studies covered in the module include optimization models in cancer diagnosis, recommendation systems for e-commerce, and image deblurring in image processing. Python is used for algorithm implementation.","title":"Optimization Algorithms for Data Modelling","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA2104 or MA2311 or departmental approval","module_credit":"4","module_code":"DSA5103","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["MA2104","MA2311"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
