{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to the field of parallel computing with hands-on parallel programming experience on real parallel machines. The module is divided into four parts parallel computation models and parallelism, parallel architectures, parallel algorithm design and programming, and new parallel computing models. Topics includes theory of parallelism and models; shared-memory architectures; distributed-memory architectures; data parallel architectures; interconnection networks, topologies and basic of communication operations; principles of parallel algorithm design; performance and scalability of parallel programs, overview of new parallel computing models such as grid, cloud, GPGPU.","title":"Parallel Computing","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS2100 or CG2007 or CG2028 or EE2024 or EE2028","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS3210","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["CS2100","CG2007","CG2028","EE2024","EE2028"]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS4231","CS4223","CS6285"],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
