However, ocean wave and wind also generate substantial loading on marine structures used for a variety of purposes, such as harnessing the power of the ocean. This module covers the fundamental concepts of ocean wave and wind that is essential for an engineer designing structures that exploit the resources of the ocean. Topics include regular wave and random wave theory, wind characteristics and resources, and wind and wave energy devices.","title":"Ocean Wind and Wave","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"CE3155A Structural Behaviour and CE3155B Structural\nModelling, or equivalent","module_credit":"2","module_code":"CE5721QA","prereq_tree":{"and":["CE3155A","CE3155B"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
