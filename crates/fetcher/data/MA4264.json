The aim of this module is to provide an introduction to game theory, studying basic concepts, models and solutions of games and their applications.\n\n\n\nMajor topics: Games of normal form and extensive form; Applications in Economics; Relations between game theory and decision making. Games of complete information: Static games with finite or infinite strategy spaces, Nash equilibrium of pure and mixed strategy; Dynamic games, backward induction solutions, information sets, subgame-perfect equilibrium, finitely and infinitely repeated games. Games of incomplete information: Bayesian equilibrium; First price sealed auction, second price sealed auction, and other auctions; Dynamic Bayesian games; Perfect Bayesian equilibrium; Signaling games. Cooperative games: Bargaining theory; Cores of n-person cooperative games; The Shapley value and its applications in voting, cost sharing, etc.","title":"Game Theory","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(MA3236 or MA3252 or DSA3102 or DSC3214 or DSN3701) and (MA2116 or MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MA4264","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["MA3236","MA3252","DSA3102","DSC3214","DSN3701"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA2116","MA2216","ST2131","ST2334"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,0,6]}
