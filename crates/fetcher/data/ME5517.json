{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Nature is an eternal source of inspiration. This course will provide an introduction to nature-inspired materials and designs. Such inspirations can come from the aspects of living and non-living things to solve engineering problems in surface engineering, optics, biomedical applications, fracture mechanics, robotics, sustainable materials, etc. The students will be examining successful applications upon utilization of nature-inspired materials and designs. This course will also cover state-of-the-art case studies in producing novel innovation with natural inspiration in interdisciplinary settings. The students will learn that the nature-inspired materials and design could offer energy- and resource-optimized products, processes and systems.","title":"Nature-inspired Materials and Design","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Bachelors degree","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME5517","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
