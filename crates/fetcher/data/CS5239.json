{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The objective of this module is to provide students a working knowledge of computer performance evaluation and capacity planning. They will be able to identify performance bottlenecks, to predict when performance limits of a system will be exceeded, and to characterise present and future workload to perform capacity planning activities. Topics include performance analysis overview; measurement techniques and tools including workload characterisation, instrumentation, benchmarking, analytical modelling techniques including operational analysis, stochastic queuing network analysis; performance of client-server architectures; capacity planning; case studies.","title":"Computer System Performance Analysis","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"((CS1020 or its equivalent) or CS2020 or (CS2030 or its equivalent) or CS2113/T) and (EE2012/A or ST2132 or ST2334 or ((MA2216 or ST2131) and (ST1131/A or ST1232 or DSC2008)))","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS5239","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["CS1020","CS2020","CS2030","CS2113","CS2113T"]},{"and":[],"or":["EE2012","EE2012A","ST2132","ST2334",{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["MA2216","ST2131"]},{"and":[],"or":["ST1131","ST1131A","ST1232","DSC2008"]}],"or":[]}]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
