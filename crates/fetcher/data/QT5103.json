{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Analysis of Boolean functions has over the years provided important tools that deepened our understanding and simplified the analysis of fundamental concepts in computer science. From the theory of voting to machine learning to pseudorandom generators, Boolean functions provide both technical tools and intuitive insight. In this classical module, we will give an introduction to these tools, and the corresponding applications.","title":"Boolean functions, and applications in computer science","department":"Center for Quantum Technologies","faculty":"NUS Graduate School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"QT5103","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,4,3]}
