{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The recent decade has witnessed the rapid development\nof porous materials and their applications in clean energy\nand environmental sustainability including storage,\nseparation, sensing, and catalysis. This module covers the\nchemistry, structure, characterization, and applications of\nvarious porous materials including zeolites, inorganic\nmesoporous materials, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs),\ncovalent organic frameworks (COFs), and other newlyemerged porous materials. It is a multidisciplinary course\nintegrating chemistry, materials science, and chemical\nengineering with a focus on addressing some of the most\nchallenging problems such as hydrogen storage, carbon\ncapture, and CO2 utilization.","title":"Fundamentals and Applications of Porous Materials","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Familiar with general chemistry and materials science.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN5432","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
