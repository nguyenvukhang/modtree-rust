{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GEH1063","description":"Modern sporting and exercise practices are mostly established based on contemporary research evidence; some, however, can just be anecdotal beliefs influenced by other non-scientific factors including those of sociocultural, media and commercial origin. The latter may lead to undesirable or even detrimental outcomes. This module draws on the fundamentals of sports physiology and nutrition to provide an evidence-based platform for inquiry-based evaluation of contemporary sporting practices, technologies and aids. It encourages critical analysis of contemporary sporting issues and also seeks to address matters related to the development of sporting culture and policies from both international and local perspectives.","title":"Inquiry into Current Sporting Beliefs and Practices","department":"Physiology","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","prerequisite":"HSI1000 or SP2274 or equivalent, or module(s) approved by host faculty","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HSI2002","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["HSI1000","SP2274"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,2,3,3]}
