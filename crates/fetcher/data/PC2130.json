{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"Students who have passed PC2130B are not allowed to take this module, YSC3210","description":"This module provides a rigorous introduction to quantum mechanics. It begins with a brief introduction to the development of quantum physics. Then it discusses topics like particle-wave duality, the Schrödinger equation, one dimensional systems like free particle, square potential well, quantum tunnelling, harmonic oscillator, and the formal description of quantum systems including Hilbert space, observables and operators, eigenfunctions, the uncertainty relations, the Dirac notation and simple two-level systems. The module ends with discussions of some stationary problems in three dimensions like particle in a box and degenerate states, the Schrödinger equation in spherical coordinates, and the hydrogen atom.","title":"Quantum Mechanics I","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students who have passed PC1101 and PC2174A or equivalent","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC2130","prereq_tree":{"and":["PC1101","PC2174A"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["PC3232","PC3233","PC3235","PC3246","PC3251","PC3288","PC3288Q","QT5101","QT5102","QT5201V","PC2135"],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
