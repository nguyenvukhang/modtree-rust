{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CG1111A, EE2111A","description":"This module exposes high school students to electrical and computer engineering principles through experiential learning. It focuses on the engineering principles and practice of how computer-aided systems are designed and built. They are first taught the fundamental principles of electronic circuits through laboratory sessions and group discussions. Through the experiential learning activities, students also build up their hands-on skills. They are then guided to apply these principles and skills to build a sensor-assisted autonomous robotic vehicle as a grand finale challenge. Upon completing the module, they can appreciate the importance of circuits, signals, and sensors in system implementation.","title":"Electrical & Computer Engineering Principles & Practice","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE1111B","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["EE2022","EE2026","EE2027","EE2028","EE2029","EE4513","CG2027"],"workload":[0.0,1.0,5.0,1.5,2.5]}
