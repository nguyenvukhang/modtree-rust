{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course teaches how to use the programming language R for analyzing and presenting statistical data. Starting from the fundamentals of R (data types, flow control), students learn how to write their own R scripts and functions. They learn how to extract data from web sites and bring the input into a shape (e.g. using regular expressions) that is suitable for further analysis. Much of the course will focus on Râ€™s graphics features, including network representations and geographic maps. The objective is to present data in ways that are informative, elegant and fun (e.g. as short animated video clips).","title":"Data Analysis and Visualization (DAVis) with R","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1122 Quantitative Reasoning or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC2210","prereq_tree":"YCC1122","fulfill_requirements":["YSC4212"],"workload":[0.0,2.0,2.0,4.0,4.5]}
