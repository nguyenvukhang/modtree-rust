{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MCH5201, ME5401, EE5101R","description":"Linear system theory is the core of modern control approaches, such as optimal, robust, adaptive and multi-variable control. This module develops a solid understanding of the fundamentals of linear systems analysis and design using the state space approach. Topics covered include state space representation of systems; solution of state equations; stability analysis using Lyapunov methods; controllability and observability; linear state feedback design; asymptotic observer and compensator design, decoupling and servo control. This module is a must for higher degree students in control engineering, robotics or servo engineering. It is also very useful for those who are interested in signal processing and computer engineering.","title":"Linear Systems","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"[Applicable to UG level students only] ME2142 or EE3331C; or\n\n[Advisory applicable to GD level students only] Requires background knowledge such as EE4302 or ME4246.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE5101","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["ME2142","EE3331C","EE4302","ME4246"]},"fulfill_requirements":["EE5104","EE6104","EE6701","EE6201"],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
