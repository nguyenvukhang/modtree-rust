We examine 5,000 years of monetary development and trace the changes in the institutions of monetary governance and stability, both domestic and international. We examine the development of monetary economics and the interplay between theory and actual monetary arrangements. We then discuss contemporary philosophical and political debates surrounding the allocation and use of the powers of money creation and destruction, including digital currencies, quantitative easing, and “modern monetary theory”.","title":"Political Economy of Money","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs including 28 MCs in PH, PS, EC, PE or PE-recognised modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.
