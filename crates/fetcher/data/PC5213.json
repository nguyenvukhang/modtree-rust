{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module discusses the molecules in cells and the physics behind their functions. At the core is the understanding of biomolecular conformations, structural stability and interactions under physical constraints such as force, geometry and temperature, by theory and state-of-art experimental technologies. Besides homework and quiz, projects are an important component of assignments. Multiple projects are provided for students to choose, which may involve numerical/Monte Carlo simulation of biomolecular conformations, analysis of experimental data, or investigation of the DNA micromechanics by analyzing DNA conformations. This module is targeted at students who have a basic knowledge in general physics and thermodynamics.","title":"Advanced Biophysics","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students with a general background in physics and have learnt thermal dynamics.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC5213","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,1,0,4,1]}
