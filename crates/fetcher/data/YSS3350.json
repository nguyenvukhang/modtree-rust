{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This seminar introduces social movement theory as an analytical and methodological framework for analyzing the emergence and evolution of social movements and contentious politics across the Muslim world from the early 20th century to the present. After introducing theoretical approaches to the study of collective action, we will work through a range of case studies of different types of movements—political and non-political, militant and non-militant, Islamist and “secular,” national and transnational—from the birth of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt in the 1920s through present-day protests in Iran and elsewhere.","title":"Social Movements in Muslim Majority Societies","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS3350","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,9.5]}
