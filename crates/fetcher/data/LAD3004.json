{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module is designed to develop advanced representational skills that make connections between software, technology and analogue modes, such as scripted algorithms, digital parametric tools, the media of film, animation, advanced fabrication and prototyping. The emphasis is not only on developing the studentsâ€™ operational knowledge of the software and representation tools, but also on enhancing their ability to customize analysis and representational methodologies for a dynamic landscape. The module will introduce emerging technologies while being relevant to legislation and emerging industry practice, such as Building Information Modelling (BIM).","title":"Landscape Representation Techniques","department":"Architecture","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LAD3004","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,2,0,2,5]}
