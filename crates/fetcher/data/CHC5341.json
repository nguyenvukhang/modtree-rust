{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"In the past decades cold war studies witnessed a paradigm shift of “cultural turn”, especially after the declassification, digitalization, and opening of official archives in various countries. Drawing upon concepts of cultural history, literary studies, and sociology of arts, this module re-examines this “battle of hearts and minds” in Asia through the lens of literary practices, print culture, film industry, and music performances. Special attentions are paid to the debates and problematics pertaining to inter-Asian connection (also disconnection), and the institutional networks of cultural production under such “psychological/media warfare” of the 1950s and 1960s.","title":"Cultural Cold War in Asia Print, Film and Music","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CHC5341","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,5,5]}
