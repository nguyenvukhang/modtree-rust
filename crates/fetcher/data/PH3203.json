{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module is concerned with an area in Moral Philosophy called 'meta-ethics'. Meta-ethics is a discussion of the nature of ethics. It is a second-order, reflective activity about ethics, and not a first-order discussion of the rights and wrongs of particular issues within ethics. Beginning with non-naturalism, the module proceeds to discuss emotivism, prescriptivism, descriptivism or naturalism, culminating in current discussion of moral realism.","title":"Moral Philosophy","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PH3203","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,0,7]}
