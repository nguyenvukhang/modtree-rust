This will enable students to design complex electronic circuits and systems for processing analog signals. Topics covered: Passive filters, poles and zeros; Transistor amplifiers, Negative feedback amplifiers; Oscillators; Mixers,\nmodulators and demodulators for communication systems; Instrumentation\namplifiers, CMRR; DC power supply design: Linear and switching regulators, current limiting; Power amplifiers: Output stage, efficiency and distortion; Active filters; Interconnections: propagation of signal and energy in transmission lines; and introduction of design techniques for integrated circuits (IC).","title":"Analog Electronics","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"EE2021 (for AY2016 intake & prior) ;\nCG2027 or EE2027 (for AY2017 intake & after)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE4407","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2.0,1.0,0.5,1.5,5.0]}
