{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"YSC3240 Foundations of Applied Mathematics","description":"This applied mathematics module introduces mathematical tools related to harmonic analysis and sparse approximation that form the basis of many classical and modern data science and signal processing methods, e.g. in imaging, audio signal processing or spectroscopy. Specific topics include data transformations in finite and infinite dimensional vector spaces (e.g., bases of eigenvectors, Fourier series, Fourier transform, frames, and wavelets) that reduce complexity and reveal structural properties, as well as optimization methods to utilize those properties to solve a variety of data science tasks. The development of the mathematical theory is combined with practical applications using Python or R.","title":"Mathematical Signal Processing","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC2232 Linear Algebra, and YSC2209 Proof, and\neither YSC1216 Calculus or YSC3206 Introduction to Real Analysis or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC4206","prereq_tree":{"and":["YSC2232","YSC2209"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,5.5,4.0]}
