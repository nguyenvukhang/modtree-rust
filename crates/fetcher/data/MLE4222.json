{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Students will explore the electronic properties of novel quantum materials. We will start from the classification of materials based on their dimensionality, electronic band structure and topology. Then we will explore mechanisms of electron conduction in novel material systems. Students will deal with real experimental data to analyze the electrical response of low-dimensional electron systems, topological insulators, superconductors and more as well as extract their properties as a function of external parameters. Next, we will discuss how to fabricate devices out of the novel material systems as well as how to perform measurements to characterize their electronic properties.","title":"Electron transport in novel quantum materials","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MLE4222","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
