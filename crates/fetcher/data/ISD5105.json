{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The accelerated, often rampant, growth of cities in Asia alters the quality of their inhabitantâ€™s lives, their ecological footprints and community bonds. Coping with urban growth affects not only those in the city; it affects also those in agricultural belts in rural peri-urban areas which are increasingly threatened by urban sprawl. \nThis module investigates various historical and economic forces shaping urban developments, identifies the elements of urbanism that have a direct impact on the environment (such as transport infrastructure) and offers insights into how sustainability principles can lead to new paradigms for urban rejuvenation and growth.","title":"Principles of Sustainable Urbanism","department":"CDE Dean's Office","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ISD5105","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,0,7]}
