{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MA3235, ISE students.","description":"Discrete optimization deals with problems of maximizing or minimizing a function over a feasible region of discrete structure. These problems come from many fields like operations research, management science and computer science. The primary objective of this module is twofold: (a) to study key techniques to separate easy problems from difficult ones and (b) to use typical methods to deal with difficult problems. \n\nMajor topics: Integer programming: cutting plane techniques, branch and bound enumeration, partitioning algorithms, the fixed charge and plant location problems. Sequencing and job-shop scheduling. Vehicle routing problems.","title":"Discrete Optimization","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"MA2215 or MA3252 or DSC3214 or DSN3701","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MA4254","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["MA2215","MA3252","DSC3214","DSN3701"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,0,6]}
