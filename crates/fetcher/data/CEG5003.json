{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CEG5001","description":"This module is aimed at giving masters students in computer engineering an opportunity to work on a cutting edge project in collaboration with the industry over two semesters. Students reinforce their knowledge and pick up new tools and skills in the process of solving problems that add value to themselves, the industry, and the society. Projects can involve a mix of research, design, and development aspects. Students work in close consultation with an internal supervisor (who is a faculty member) and an external (industry) supervisor. Students will need to submit a report, as well as a presentation to the supervisors.","title":"Computer Engineering Project","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"8","module_code":"CEG5003","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,7,3]}
