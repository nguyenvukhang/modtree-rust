{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module maps out the main currents of contemporary social theories ranging from the legacy of the classical tradition, comparative-historical sociology, interpretative sociology, functionalism and neo-functionalism, rational choice, globalization theories and the macro-micro debates. In exploring the nature and status of social scientific theories we deal with the universalism/relativism debate and link it to the problems of globalized vs. indigenized social theories. This module is mounted for students with a keen interest in social theories.","title":"Contemporary Social Theory","department":"Sociology and Anthropology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC, or 28MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SC, or 28MCs in PS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non‚Äêlanguage modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"SC4201","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,6.5]}
