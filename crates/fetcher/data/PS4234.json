The sources of identity that are investigated include the self, group, society, and state, as well as their more complicated combinations. The identities whose origins, maintenance, and effects we study are nation, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexuality, and race. The approaches we take to make sense of identity politics include writings in political science, social psychology, sociology, history, anthropology, and cultural and post-colonial studies.","title":"Identity Politics","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in PS or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"PS4234","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,7.5]}
