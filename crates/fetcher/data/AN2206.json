{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"SC2221","description":"Did nature make humans, or have humans made nature? Or, are both continuously co-evolving, each changing in relation to the other? This module explores the socio-political dynamics, practices and institutions through which societies endeavour to understand and appropriate the natural world. We examine how different societies engage with nature, and how these engagements have in turn shaped social thought. In addition to exploring the way humans across time and space have constructed their understandings and relationships with nature, topics also include urban ecology and infrastructure, biotechnology, bio-capitalism, international energy politics, climate change, ‘natural’ disasters, global environmental inequality, conservation and environmentalism.","title":"Humans and Natures","department":"Sociology and Anthropology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"AN2206","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
