{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"Not required","description":"In the data intensive and data centric era, memories are essential electronic devices for data processing and storage. The first part of this module focuses on physics, materials, and device aspects of various memories that are in mainstream such as SRAM, DRAM, and Flash memory, as well as those under extensive research and development including ferroelectric memory, resistive memory, and magnetic random access memory. The second part will cover emerging applications using these memories, including memory-peripheral circuits, non-volatile CMOS and memory-centric microarchitectures for IoT, and beyond Moore microarchitectures.","title":"Memory Technologies and Their Emerging Applications","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Requires background such as Microelectronics Materials and Devices, EE4435 Modern Transistors and Memory Devices","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE5442","prereq_tree":"EE4435","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
