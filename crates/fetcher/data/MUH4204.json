{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module is an intensive survey of Western music that encourages students to critically assess and challenge existing historical narratives and canonic thinking. Students will review and study in detail all historical aspects associated with the creation of music, including genres, styles, historical periods, composersâ€™ lives and works, and patrons. Students will continually consider and question the motivations behind the inclusion and exclusion of artists and artworks in the constructed stories of music. Modes of teaching, learning, and assessment are designed to prepare students for graduate-level music history modules, with an emphasis on independent, inquiry-based learning.","title":"Learning and Challenging the Historical Narrative","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"3rd and 4th year BMus students only","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MUH4204","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,4,4]}
