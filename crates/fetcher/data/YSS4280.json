{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Sometimes markets are tremendous engines of economic growth, and sometimes they are not. This course invokes political institutions to explain variation in the performance of economic markets. All markets are characterized by various types of failures, including problems associated with common pool resources, credible commitments, collective action, externalities, and intertemporal choices, among others. However, some societies overcome market failures by means of effective institutions, while others do not. Combining readings in political science, historical institutionalism, and the New Institutional Economics, this course illuminates market failures, institutional solutions, and the political origins of institutions.","title":"Markets and Institutions","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1121 Comparative Social Inquiry and YSS1206 Introduction to Comparative Politics or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS4280","prereq_tree":{"and":["YCC1121","YSS1206"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,6.5]}
