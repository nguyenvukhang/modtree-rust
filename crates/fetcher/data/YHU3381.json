{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Designed as an introduction to the arts of Southeast Asia, this course explores images (sculpted in stone, cast in bronze, printed on clay, or painted) from around the 5th to 15th century, when Hinduism and Buddhism first developed in the region. We examine the creation and use of these religious images in their original contexts, as well as their later histories. Throughout this course, students will engage with major theoretical debates in the art history of Southeast Asia, looking at the history of interpretation of ancient images, as well as their contemporary use by modern nation-states and later artists.","title":"Image and Interpretation in Southeast Asian Art History","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3381","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,6.5,6.0]}
