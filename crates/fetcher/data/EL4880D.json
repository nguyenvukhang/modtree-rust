{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Fundamental importance is assigned to speakersâ€™ introspective judgments of sentence acceptability in syntactic research. However, such judgments can be gravely compromised by instability of different kinds, which calls into question the empirical reliability of such data. In this module, students will learn objective and practical methods by which they may collect and analyse acceptability judgments. We will discuss experimental design, data visualisation, statistical analysis, and the application of experimental methods to theoretical questions. This will be a hands-on course, and students will be expected to lead discussions on primary research.","title":"Experimental Syntax","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including (i) 28 MCs in EL, and (ii) EL2101 or with instructor's consent, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"EL4880D","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,4.0,5.5]}
