{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CN4122E","description":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical\nprocesses.","title":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"TCN2116, TCN2121, TCN3124 & TCN3132","module_credit":"3","module_code":"TCN4122","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["TCN2116","TCN2121","TCN3124"]},"TCN3132"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["TCN4124"],"workload":[2.0,2.0,0.0,1.5,2.0]}
