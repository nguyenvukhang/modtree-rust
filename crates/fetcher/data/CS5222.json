{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The aim of this module is to introduce the state-of-the-art architectural advances underlying the current generation of computing systems. A review of pipelined processor design and hierarchical memory design is followed by advanced topics including exploitation of instruction-level parallelism through dynamic instruction scheduling and speculation, exploiting thread-level parallelism through\nmultiprocessors, and optimizations for memory and storage subsystems. Throughout the module, particular emphasis will be placed on cost-performance-power-reliability trade-offs in designing the different architectural components.","title":"Advanced Computer Architecture","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS3220 Computer Architecture or CS4223 Multi-core Architecture","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS5222","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["CS3220","CS4223"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,4,4]}
