{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MLE3102 Degradation & Failure of Materials\nME5506 Corrosion of Materials","description":"Saving energy is far more environmentally friendly than creating it. Thus, making materials last longer has to be at the heart of any practical sustainable policy. For example, in the UK alone 1 tonne of steel converted to rust every 90 seconds, the energy required to make this 1 tonne of steel is sufficient to provide average family with power for 3 months, plus 2.5 tonnes of CO2 are generated for every tonne of steel produced; more if one includes transporting the iron ore and the steel itself. The module includes corrosion of metals, degradation of polymers and photocorrosion of semiconductors.","title":"Degradation of Materials","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MLE5224","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,6.5]}
