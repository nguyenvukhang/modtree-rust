AIoT aims to create systems that can complete a set of tasks or make decisions autonomously and intelligently through learning from data. Such smart systems can drive efficiency, effectiveness and innovation across a wide range of industries such as retail, logistics and transportation. Students will learn how to build IoT infrastructure with edge computing and cloud computing architectures for collecting sensor data and to apply basic machine learning algorithms to these data to train models that power smart systems.","title":"AIoT Solutions and Development","department":"Information Systems and Analytics","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"IS2103 and IS3106","module_credit":"4","module_code":"IS4151","prereq_tree":{"and":["IS2103","IS3106"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,2,3,3]}
