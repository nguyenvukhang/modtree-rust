{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Cell culture meat aims to serve as an alternative protein source through an unconventional meat harvesting method. It is produced via the cultivation of specific stem cells enabling the formation of bio-artificial muscles as a form, of animal proteins for consumption. The application of such technology is a promising way to increase protein production in a resource-scarce environment. The students should be able to critically evaluate the scientific merit of cell-based protein production using the industrial biotechnology method and describe how potential societal, ethical and legal factors can affect the successful introduction of such food sources to the consumers.","title":"Cell Based Proteins for a Sustainable Future","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"HSI1000 or SP2274 or equivalent, or module(s) approved by host faculty","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HSI2004","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["HSI1000","SP2274"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,4,2]}
