In this course, we will explore the principles and techniques of chemical measurements, the complex chemical equilibria that are associated with most measurements, and the statistical tools for analyzing and improving measurement data. The laboratory component comprises a variety of instrumental techniques as well as the quantitative analysis of measurement data.","title":"Analytical Chemistry with Laboratory","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1207 General Chemistry or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC2248","prereq_tree":"YSC1207","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,6.5]}
