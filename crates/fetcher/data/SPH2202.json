Such approaches are required to solve many of the complex nutritional challenges, such as obesity, type-2 diabetes, micronutrient deficiencies, and hunger, which we face today. In this class we will study fundamental concepts related to nutrition, understand frameworks used to examine public health issues, and examine key historical and current public health nutrition challenges and policies.","title":"Public Health Nutrition","department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SPH2202","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.5,0.0,0.0,3.0,3.5]}
