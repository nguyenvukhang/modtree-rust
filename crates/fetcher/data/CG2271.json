{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CS2106 Introduction to Operating Systems","description":"Real-time systems must respond quickly to inputs from the environment in order to work effectively and safely, and realtime operating systems (RTOS) are a critical part of such systems. In this course the student is exposed to basic RTOS concepts like tasks, scheduling algorithms, RTOS customisation and concurrent real-time programming. By the end of this course a student will not only understand how an RTOS is built, but will also gain practical hands-on experience in customising RTOSs and in writing real-time programs.","title":"Real-Time Operating Systems","department":"Computing and Engineering Programme","faculty":"Multi Disciplinary Programme","prerequisite":"(CS1020 or its equivalent) or (CS2040 or its equivalent)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CG2271","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["CS1020","CS2040"]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS3211","CS3235","CS3271","CS4344","CS4223","CS5271","CS5272","CS5250","EE5903","CG3002","CG4002"],"workload":[2,1,2,3,2]}
