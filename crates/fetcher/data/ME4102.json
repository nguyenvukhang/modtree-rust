{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Standards provide requirements, specifications, guidelines or characteristics that can be used consistently to ensure that products, processes and services are fit for their purposes.\n\nIn this module, we aim to create awareness of, demonstrate and teach various standards currently used in mechanical engineering practices. Two key categories in mechanical engineering are selected, namely sustainable energy and medical technology. After giving a broad overview of the standards landscape in mechanical engineering, it will focus on the standards associated with the two identified categories, and relate them to real world examples. They will be discussed in lectures, student group discussions/projects, etc.","title":"Standards in Mechanical Engineering","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME4102","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,4,2]}
