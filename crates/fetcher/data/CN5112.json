{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"ML5212 Energy Conversion & Storage","description":"Electrochemical processes are crucial for sustaining our daily lives from the batteries that power our electronics to the industrial production of aluminium. This module will give students sound working knowledge on the fundamental concepts of electrochemistry, introduction to theoretical concepts and common electrochemical methods. In addition, we will cover some important applications of electrochemistry such as electrodeposition, photoelectrochemistry, and electrocatalysis for water splitting and CO2 conversion to chemicals/fuels. Students are assessed by means of small individual homework assignments, a mid-term and a final exam.","title":"Introduction to Electrochemical Systems","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN5112","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
