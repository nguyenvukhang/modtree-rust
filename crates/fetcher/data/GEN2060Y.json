{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Many seniors are lonely or estranged, isolated from critical social networks and support structures. Volunteers provide the vital link to reconnect them with society and restore their well-being. In this module, students will learn key concepts in volunteerism, and essential skills, including communications, conflict management, needs identification and risk assessment, to support vulnerable seniors identified by the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), checking on them regularly to provide emotional support and early intervention, if needed. Thus, students will develop empathy, and sharpen observation and decision-making skills.","title":"Reconnect SeniorsSG","department":"Office of Sr Dy Pres and Provost","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GEN2060Y","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,2,0,4,3]}
