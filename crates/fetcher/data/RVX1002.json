{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"UTW1001 and UTW2001 series modules","description":"This module examines meaning and culture. It draws attention to issues in translation and intercultural communication, and advocates the use of a framework that facilitates effective communication with cultural others at work or elsewhere. As cultural beings, we express meaning in a cultural context, but do we understand the implications? We assume that English words have the same meaning across cultures, but how valid is this assumption? We learn Standard English but does it embody the cultural meanings we want to express? This module raises awareness of our cultural selves and helps students develop meaningful connections with cultural others.","title":"What do you mean?
