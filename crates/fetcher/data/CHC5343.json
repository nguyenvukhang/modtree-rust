Following a chronological order, this module will expose the students to studies of material culture, social-cultural history, as well as literary history in general. By tackling questions like how letters that were supposedly private became widely circulated and how epistolary literature became literary genres in premodern China, students will get unique insights into the literary past beyond classical poetry and prose.","title":"History of Chinese Epistolary Literature","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CHC5343","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,5,5]}
