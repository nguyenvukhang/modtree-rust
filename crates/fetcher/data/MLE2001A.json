{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"We will explore what makes materials the way they are and why. We will discover the structure of the materials that make up our modern world and learn how it influences the properties, performance and applications of these materials. We will learn the difference between amorphous and crystalline materials, learn how the materials structure can be measured, and show that materials defects are responsible for the functionality of our computers, steel bridges or airplanes. The significance of these issues in modern industry will be emphasized through case studies.","title":"Materials Science & Engineering Principles & Practice II","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MLE2001A","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,1,0,5]}
