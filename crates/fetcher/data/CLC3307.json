This module introduces students to various community-based approaches to literacy, such as critical literacy, multi literacies, participatory literacy education and social partnerships. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we will also examine the practices, contexts and power relations concerning literacy that are essential to community development.","title":"Literacy and Community Development","department":"Chua Thian Poh Comm Leader Center","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CLC3307","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,4,3]}
