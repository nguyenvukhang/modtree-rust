{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module examines fundamental aspects of computation that every computer scientist should know. What is a finite automaton and how does it relate to regular expressions (and searching a database)? What is a context-free language and how does it relate to parsing languages? What is the P vs. NP problem and why does it matter? How do we decide if a problem is easy or hard? This module introduces techniques for precisely formulating problems and studying their properties using a variety of commonly used reasoning techniques (e.g., model equivalence, non-determinism, digitalisation, simulation and reduction).","title":"Theory of Computation","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"(CS1231 or equivalent) and (CS2040 or its equivalent)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS3231","prereq_tree":{"and":["CS1231","CS2040"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
