{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EG1111","description":"This is part 1 of a 2-module package â€“ Engineering\nPrinciples and Practice - that introduces Year 1 students\nto what engineers do and the engineer's thought process.\nEPP I focuses on the engineering principles of how\nsystems work and fail, and the engineering practice of\nhow they are designed, built and valued. Given a\npractical engineering system, e.g. a drone, or an\nengineering event, e.g. the Challenger space shuttle\ndisaster, students are guided to deconstruct the system\ninto inter-connected sub-systems. Following which they\nwill develop an understanding of how forces, energy flow\nand/or mass flow between sub-systems impact the whole.","title":"Engineering Principles and Practice I","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME1102","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["EE4513","ME2121","ME2134","ME2115"],"workload":[3,1,0,0,6]}
