{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"As stories are told at a dinner-party, Socrates claims, the “only thing I know is the art of love”. How are the arts of knowledge, erôs, and story-telling related? From Plato to Freud, love inspires creative thought while putting at risk rational argumentation, conscious will, and the orderly relation of body, self, and society.
