{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"What is “modern art” in “Southeast Asia”? When and how did it emerge? In what ways have modern art and its histories been discussed, as distinct yet also connected to the modern art of other regions? This module explores these questions by guiding students through key historical approaches to the relationship between art and modernity in Southeast Asia, since the 19th century. The module’s thematic structure pairs historical and methodological concepts with diverse case studies from visual art and other cultural forms. This equips students with the skills for critically reflexive considerations of relationships between art, modernity, and Southeast Asia.","title":"Southeast Asian Art and Modernity","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"AH2101","module_credit":"4","module_code":"AH3205","prereq_tree":"AH2101","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,2,5]}
