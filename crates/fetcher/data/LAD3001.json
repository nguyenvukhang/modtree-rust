{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course continues to develop a level of competence in design skills and critical thinking through a design task that increases the scale and complexity of considerations. Focusing on a high-dense urban context, students will be asked to retrofit existing neighbourhood landscapes in residential blocks/towns. The emphasis will be liveability and sustainability and will involve the integration of required spaces/facilities and innovative landscape elements within a high-dense urban context. They will work across a range of representational modes including technical diagrams and three dimensional physical/digital modelling to develop relative certainty in the functional and aesthetic aspects of their design proposal.","title":"Design 5","department":"Architecture","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Min C grade for LAD2001 Design 3 / LAD2006 Design 3 and LAD2002 Design 4 / LAD2007 Design 4","module_credit":"8","module_code":"LAD3001","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["LAD3005"],"workload":[1,2,0,5,12]}
