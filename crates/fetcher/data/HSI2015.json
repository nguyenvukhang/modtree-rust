{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The essence of nanoscience and nanotechnology is the ability to understand and manipulate matter at atomic and molecular levels, to create artificial structures with fundamentally new atomic and molecular organizations. In this course, students will learn that crystal, electronic, optical, and magnetic structures behave differently and exhibit novel physical, chemical and biological properties when their dimensions are reduced to the range of 1â€“100 nanometers. The nanoworld is an exciting new realm that brings together multidisciplines. Its impact on society is expected to be as significant as the combined antibiotics, integrated circuits and polymers in the twentieth century.","title":"The Emerging Nanoworld","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HSI2015","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,3,3]}
