{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module is an introductory module to the science of colloids and interface with specific reference to the application in food systems. By the end of the module, students are expected to understand what is a colloid, the fundamentals of colloidal stability such as the forces leading to the instability of colloids, as well as how colloids can be stabilised. Some examples of the application of colloid science in some food colloid systems such as emulsion, gel, foam etc. will be discussed.","title":"Food Colloids and Components Science","department":"Food Science and Technology","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"FST3105 & FST3106","module_credit":"4","module_code":"FST4103","prereq_tree":{"and":["FST3105","FST3106"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,3,2,2]}
