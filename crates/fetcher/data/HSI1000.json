Not only will this module help answer these questions, but it will also hone the skills needed to negotiate a world in the post-truth era. These skills derive from the scientific method; the characteristic of modern science that has made it without a doubt the most successful endeavour in human history. These questions and these skills will be woven within a rich history of scientific accomplishment, culminating in an understanding of the frightening challenges we face to mitigate climate change and biodiversity loss.","title":"How Science Works, Why Science Works","department":"FoS Dean's Office","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HSI1000","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["HSI2003","HSI2002","HSI2004","HSI2005","HSI2001","HSI2008","HSI2013","HSI2009","HSI2010","HSI2014","HSI2012","HSI2007","HSI2011"],"workload":[2,0,1,3,4]}
