{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Neurotechnology provides technical tools for neuroscience research and clinical application. The continued innovation and development of neurotechnology allows us to explore wonders of our brain and mind, as well as to treat neurological and other diseases. This course introduces a variety of neuroengineering approaches to establish direct communication with nervous system and the mechanisms behind them. This course will cover the following topics understanding of the nervous system from an engineering perspective, design of neuroelectronics, mechanical and biochemical requirements of neural interfacing materials, electrical/optical/biochemical/acoustic/magnetic neural interfaces and their applications in both research and clinical applications.","title":"Frontiers in Neurotechnology","department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BN5209","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
