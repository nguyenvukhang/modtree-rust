{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The solutions to the global energy crisis lie in harnessing what Mother Nature has already provided. This module aims to help students discover the scientific underpinnings of natural phenomena that can be tapped for energy production and storage. Students will learn about the physical principles behind harnessing energy from the sun, ocean, wind and atomic nuclei (nuclear energy), as well as forms of energy storage such as batteries and fuel cells. The impact of these technologies on the environment will also be discussed. All physics concepts will be taught as needed. The module is suitable for students from diverse backgrounds.","title":"Energy for a Better World","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC1101 and PC2421","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC2423","prereq_tree":{"and":["PC1101","PC2421"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,0,7]}
