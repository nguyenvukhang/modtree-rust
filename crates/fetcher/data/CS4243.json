{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EE4212 Computer Vision\nEE4704 (Image Processing and Analysis)","description":"This module is for undergraduates who are interested in computer vision and its applications. It covers (a) the basic skills needed in handling images and videos, (b) the basic theories needed to understand geometrical computer vision, and (c) pattern recognition. Topics covered in image handling include contrast stretch, histogram equalization, noise removal, and color space. Topics covered in geometrical vision include affine transform, vanishing points, camera projection models, homography, camera calibration, rotation representations including quaternions, epipolar geometry, binocular stereo, structure from motion. Topics covered for pattern recognition include principal component analysis.","title":"Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"((CS1020 or its equivalent) or (((CS2030 or its equivalent) or CS2113/T) and (CS2040 or its equivalent))) and \n(MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1508E or MA1513) and \n(MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1507 or (MA1511 and MA1512) or MA1521) and \n(EE2012/A or MA2216 or ST1131/A or ST1232 or ST2131 or ST2334)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS4243","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["CS1020",{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["CS2030","CS2113","CS2113T"]},"CS2040"],"or":[]}]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1101R","MA1311","MA1508E","MA1513"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1102R","MA1505","MA1507",{"and":["MA1511","MA1512"],"or":[]},"MA1521"]},{"and":[],"or":["EE2012","EE2012A","MA2216","ST1131","ST1131A","ST1232","ST2131","ST2334"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS6240"],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
