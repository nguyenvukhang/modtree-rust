Then it covers issues and techniques dealing with multi-user application environments, namely, transactions, concurrency control, and recovery. The third part covers advanced topics such as on-line analytical processing, in-memory databases, and column stores.","title":"Database Systems Implementation","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"((CS2010 or its equivalent) or CS2020 or (CS2040 or its equivalent)) and (CS2102 or IT2002)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS3223","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["CS2010","CS2020","CS2040"]},{"and":[],"or":["CS2102","IT2002"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS4221","CS5226","CS5322","CS6203","CS4224","CS5421","CS5424"],"workload":[2,1,0,3,3]}
