A college student should therefore graduate with some understanding of what is not computable, and the complexity of what is computable.  The student will learn from this module: \n\n(a) some standard models of computation, so as to gain an understanding of what can or cannot be computed by various computing devices; \n(b) some reasoning techniques commonly used in computer science, including nondeterminism, diagonalization, simulation and reduction; and \n(c) some mathematical formulation of objects in computer science, so as to study their properties.","title":"Theory of Computation","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1212 Introduction to Computer Science and YSC2209 Proof or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC4232","prereq_tree":{"and":["YSC1212","YSC2209"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
