{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module focuses on marine and coastal environments with an emphasis on salt marshes, seagrass, kelp, mangrove, and coral reef habitats. We will study the carbon and nutrient cycles of these ecosystems and their interaction with the surrounding water environments. We will also discuss how these ecosystems could help mitigate the impact of sea-level rise and climate change. The presented material will cover 1) the role of blue carbon for climate change mitigation targets; 2) the role of aquatic vegetation in coastal erosion; 3) successes and failures of restoration projects.","title":"Nature Based Solutions for Coastal Protection","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"2","module_code":"CE5317B","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
