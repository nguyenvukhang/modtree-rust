We will pay special attention to the historical, intellectual and social world of the European Middle Ages and the fraught legacy of the classical tradition. We will experience the sublime and terrifying grandeur of his cosmic vision, discuss theology and revelation, the state of souls in the afterlife, the primacy of poetry as an intellectual and spiritual activity, the nature of art and beauty, the relationship between pagan myths and Christian mysteries, and the medieval encyclopaedia of classical learning and religious doctrine. \nBased on student interest, we might work on volume 2 of the Dante Journal of Singapore, highlighting the original research of the seminar participants.","title":"Dante’s Divine Comedy","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"Completion of all Year 1 Common Curriculum modules or with permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3290","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,9.5,0.0]}
