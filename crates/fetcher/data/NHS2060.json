{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Nothing features more prominently among fundamental human activities than the production of food. In this module, we examine various modes of primary food production and the array of socioeconomic issues each entails, including subsistence agriculture, lowland rice farming, industrial food production, and emergent forms of organic produce by small- and medium-sized enterprises. Topics focus on how social dimensions of food production intersect with other areas of inquiry, including environmental sustainability and degradation, social mobility and marginalization, food security, public health, and globalization. This module includes an intensive fieldwork component in which students experience first hand different modes of food production.","title":"Food Production and Society in Southeast Asia","department":"NUS College Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NHS2060","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,4,2]}
