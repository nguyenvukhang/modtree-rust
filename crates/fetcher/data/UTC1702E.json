Do energy policies lead to a sustainable energy development? Would renewables solve our future energy needs, mitigate emissions and protect our environment? Students deal with such energy challenges by learning to understand ‘energy systems’ as a ‘complex\nwhole’. This module provides a platform for students to understand the complex behavior arising from interdependent interactions of different actors of energy systems with other economic, political, social, technological and environmental factors. To achieve this, it engages students to learn and apply systems thinking tools to such aforementioned challenges through relevant models, case studies and real-world energy policy/problem scenarios.","title":"Thinking in Systems: Energy Systems","department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTC1702E","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,2,0,4,4]}
