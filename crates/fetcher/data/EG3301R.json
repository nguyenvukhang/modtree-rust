Through lecture classes, studio sessions and an open-ended project, students learn how to create a product idea to address a problem of interest, generate and evaluate concept designs, and build proof-of-concept prototypes for user testing. Students also learn how to work in a multidisciplinary team and with various stakeholders, manage the execution of their project, and document and present their work through appropriate mediums.","title":"Ideas to Proof-of-Concept","department":"CDE Dean's Office","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Stage 2 standing.","module_credit":"12","module_code":"EG3301R","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["EG4301A"],"workload":[3,0,3,9,0]}
