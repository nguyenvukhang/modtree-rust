{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"Variable, depend on the choice of topics or departmental approval.","description":"Reinforcement learning studies how an AI agent interacts with its environment and learns according to its experiences. The advances in recent years, especially since the introduction of deep reinforcement learning, have been significant and mpactful. Examples include AlphaGo, AlphaStar, OpenAI Five, chip design, nuclear fusion plasma controller etc. In this course, we will cover advanced topics in reinforcement learning. Students will be exposed to classic and recent papers on these topics. Students are expected to have a basic understanding of deep learning and reinforcement learning. Familiarity with tensor programming libraries (such as TensorFlow, JAX, PyTorch, etc) is required.","title":"Topics in Computer Science: Advanced Topics in Reinforcement Learning","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"(CS3244 or CS3264)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS6284","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["CS3244","CS3264"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,4,4]}
