{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","description":"This topic-based module develops quantitative reasoning skills through a structured analysis of an important but accessible problem, imparting to students the appreciation that, for many questions/issues, a quantitative analysis can provide the insight and clarity that complements and moves beyond what might be gained through a qualitative approach.  \n\nThis module focuses on quantifying aspects of nuclear risks. Students will pose a question related to nuclear risks (e.g. What is the lowest dose of radiation that can lead to cancer?), propose a method to measure the relevant variables, collect the necessary data, and make scientifically justifiable inferences from it. Students will thus perform all aspects of a genuine scientific study, from problem formulation to decision making and final reporting.","title":"Quantitative Reasoning Foundation: Quantifying Nuclear Risks","department":"NUS College Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS College","prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NST2040","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,4,0,3,3]}
