{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Modern Social Thought engages foundational figures of modern social thought, exploring how their writings have been taken up in political practice in different parts of the world. Starting with Ibn Khaldun’s pre-modern analysis of society we proceed to the ideas of major thinkers such as Alexis de Tocqueville, Karl Marx, Emile Durkheim, Max Weber, and Michel Foucault, all of whom acknowledged the explanatory power of modern social theory. The course will also grapple with several other characteristically modern developments including feminism and postcolonial thought in Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex and Michel Foucault’s History of Sexuality, and other works.","title":"Modern Social Thought","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1, YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 and YCC1121 Comparative Social Inquiry  or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YCC2121","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["YCC1113","YCC1114"]},"YCC1121"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["YSS2210","YSS3212","YSS3218","YSS3223","YSS3235","YSS3231","YSS3222","YSS4209","YSS4215","YHU3266","YHU4220","YSS3255","YSS4208","YSS4220","YSS4208B","YID2207","YSS3263","YSS3268","YHU4231","YSS4232","YSS4229","YSS4228","YSS4244","YSS3277","YSS4246","YSS3293","YSS3297","YHU2314","YSS3309","YSS4261","YSS3318","YSS3319","YHU3352","YSS3327","YSS4266","YSS4267","YHU3357","YSS3332","YHU3363","YHU3369","YSS4275","YSS4277","YSS4279","YID3226"],"workload":[1.0,3.0,0.0,8.5,0.0]}
