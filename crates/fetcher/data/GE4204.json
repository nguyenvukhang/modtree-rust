{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Geographers have contributed much to understandings of urban lives, landscapes and processes. Urban Space Critical Perspectives explores this contribution in two interrelated ways. First, through an examination of key themes in geographical analyses of cities and urban regions. These range from housing and infrastructure provision to mobility and labour market issues. And, second, through an engagement with diverse histories and geographies of cities. This involves a questioning of the spatiality of urban processes in various regions of the world, interrogating Euro-American-centred conceptions of urbanization and discussing alternative perspectives. The module thus examines both urban geographies and geo-histories of 'the urban'.","title":"Urban Space:Critical Perspectives","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GE or 28 MCs in SN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track. \n\n(Global Studies students)\nCompleted at least 80MCs, including 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GE, or 28 MCs in SN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"GE4204","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,9.5]}
