This course will provide students with a foundation for computer vision and image processing, which is important for those intending to proceed to biomedical engineering, intelligent systems and multimedia signal processing. The following topics are taught elements of a vision system, image acquisition, 2-D discrete Fourier transform, image enhancement techniques, theoretical basis and techniques for image compression, segmentation methods including edge detection, and feature extraction such as texture measurement.","title":"Image Processing and Analysis","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"EE2023/CG2023","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE4704","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["EE2023","CG2023"]},"fulfill_requirements":["EE5731","EE4309"],"workload":[2.5,1.0,0.5,0.0,5.0]}
