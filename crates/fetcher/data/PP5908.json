{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Financial markets’ meltdown, climate change, and cyber-threats are only some of the global problems that states cannot  manage  alone.  All  require  cooperation among governments  and  increasingly  with  their  citizens  and  the private  sector;  some  need  international  norms  and mechanisms;  others  call  for  international  and  regional organizations. This course provides an introduction to the evolving architecture,  processes,  and  norms  of  global governance.  It  then  provides  an  in-depth  analysis  of  the actors,  norms,  and  challenges  in  the  supply  of  some of today’s  critical  global  public  goods,  including  financial stability,  economic  development,  trade,  climate  change mitigation, global health, and a secure cyberspace.","title":"Global Governance in a Changing World","department":"LKYSPP Dean's Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PP5908","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
