This module offers a deep dive into the nature and ethics of wealth inequality. It has two parts. We first address a theoretical question When, if ever, is inequality morally wrong? This lays the foundation for the second part, where we examine the causes and consequences of wealth inequality, along with possible responses. The aim is to critically examine our attitudes and policies as we strive for a just and practical distribution of wealth.","title":"How Rich Should Anyone Be?","department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying\nEnglish Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic\nPurposes modules.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTW1001T","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,4,0,0,6]}
