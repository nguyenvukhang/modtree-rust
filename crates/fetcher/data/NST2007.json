{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Situated within a megadiverse biodiversity-hotspot, Singapore has drastically-reduced natural areas yet remains surprisingly species-rich. Combined with her colonial legacy, infrastructural capabilities and cultural biases, Singapore offers a unique situation for studying biodiversity. In this module, we study how Singapore’s biodiversity landscape as well as the motivations and methods for studying biodiversity have evolved across Singapore’s history. Retracing how prominent naturalists explored Singapore’s biodiversity in the past, we imagine how they would do it today using current techniques. This module has a strong fieldwork component, imbuing students with naturalist sensibilities which heightens their awareness of Singapore’s diverse but oft-neglected natural heritage.","title":"Biodiversity and Natural History in Singapore","department":"NUS College Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NST2007","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":"2/4*-2/4*-2/4*-2/4*-6"}
