{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CL3286","description":"This module presents a comprehensive overview of the major theoretical paradigms (e.g., equivalence, Skopos theory, descriptive translation studies, effort models for interpreting) in translation and interpreting studies (TIS). In the analysis of landmark examples of empirical research on translation and interpreting, we illustrate how theories are integrated into translation and interpreting practices. Through lectures, class discussions and readings, students will gain insight into the central conceptual and empirical issues in the TIS field.","title":"Translation and Interpreting Theories","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"TRA2101 or INT2101 or CL2280 or CL2281","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TRA3206","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["TRA2101","INT2101","CL2280","CL2281"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,2,5]}
