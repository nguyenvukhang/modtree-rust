{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This seminar surveys the major theoretical perspectives and issues studied in strategic management research. The course draws upon theoretical perspectives from economics, sociology and organisation theory to supplement more traditional strategy approaches towards understanding firm performance and related issues. An illustrative list of the issues addressed in strategy research includes identifying the profit potential of industries, exploring relationships between firm resources, behaviour and performance, and understanding the managerial and organisational determinants of firm level outcomes. Many of the issues examined, for example, vertical integration, firm diversification, industry structure, and inter-organisational cooperation, are also common themes in other disciplines such as industrial organisation economics, marketing, and organisational and economic sociology.","title":"Theory of Strategic Management","department":"Strategy and Policy","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BBP6781","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,8]}
