{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This capstone module will provide opportunities for students to apply theory and practice to their individual projects. Students will have the option to produce 1) an empirical study for academic or industry research, 2) an integrative literature review that synthesises a theory or concept useful for their future career or higher research degree application, or 3) an individual portfolio that integrates theoretical perspectives students have gained in the entire programme. Ultimately, students will develop independent research and project management skills in order to complete their proposed project that is beneficial for their future academic endeavours and/or professional careers.","title":"Final Year Project in Communication","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed at least 20MCs of NMC modules, including the core modules for the studentâ€™s specialisation.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NMC5307","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,7,3]}
