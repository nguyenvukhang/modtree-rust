{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CO5234 Developing health proposals using DME skills & tools","description":"Two of the most important skills that public health practitioners need to develop are programme design and proposal writing. These two skills are inseparably linked. A good programme design in a good proposal can lead to better implementation and management, and sets the stage for good monitoring and evaluation. In turn, a project executed well has better chances for re-funding and expansion by donors. This skills-building design, implementation monitoring and evaluation (DIME) course is designed to introduce students to the working environment that one will confront repeatedly.","title":"Developing health proposals using DIME skills & tools","department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","prerequisite":"SPH5002 Public Health Research Methods; and\nSPH5007 Implementing Public Health Programmes and Policies","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SPH5410","prereq_tree":{"and":["SPH5002","SPH5007"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[10,0,0,10,20]}
