{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"COS2000","description":"This module introduces students to computational thinking as applied to problems in science, with special emphasis on their implementation with Python/Python Notebook (Jupyter). A selection of examples will be chosen to illustrate (a) fundamentals of algorithm design in computer programming (b) solution interpretation, as well as (c) analysis of the computational solutions and data visualization using state-of-the-art tools in Python. The selection will tackle different types of approaches typically used in scientific computational thinking, including deterministic, probabilistic and approximation methods. The module will also highlight scientific computational issues such as accuracy and convergence of numerical results.","title":"Computational Thinking for Scientists","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"COS1000","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,3,2,3]}
