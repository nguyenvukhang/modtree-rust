{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module explores a range of intersecting socioÂ­technological domains in both historical and contemporary settings. What is the relationship between technology and work? How do technological advances intersect with work infrastructures? What is the impact of emergent technologies upon our identities, social relations and material conditions? By harnessing anthropology as a social scientific discipline, we query, through ethnographic analyses of science and technology, the sociocultural value and import of technology upon social actors in their everyday life experiences. Core themes and discourses revolving around such areas as communications, biotechnology, genetics, technoscience and big data will be addressed.","title":"Anthropology of Technology","department":"Sociology and Anthropology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"AN3209","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
