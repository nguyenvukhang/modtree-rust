{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The desire to systemically control the city using information is as old as the history of urban planning. This seminar examines Smart Cities through a retrospection into the history and theory of urban data and computational models in urban planning. Learning from the technocratic planners (1910s-1920s), the cybernetic vision and urban renewal (1960s), the development of GIS (1960s), critical GIS (1990s), Big data and civic technologies (2010s), the course critically examines contemporary Smart Cities that include but are not limited to Masdar, Songdo, Sidewalk Lab Toronto, and Singaporeâ€™s Smart Nation initiatives.","title":"Smart Cities: History of Urban Data in Urban Planning","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS4284","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,6.5]}
