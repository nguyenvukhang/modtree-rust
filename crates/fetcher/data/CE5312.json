{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module covers the introduction and analysis of flows in open channels. The basic concepts, the fundamental laws of fluid mechanics (conservation of mass, momentum, and energy), and the hydraulic jump will be introduced, followed by the introduction and analysis of the uniform flow, gradually varied flow, rapidly varied flow, and unsteady flow. The knowledge will be applied to the computation of the flows and designs of hydraulic structures. Analytical and numerical techniques will be discussed, and programming assignments will be carried out in widely-used software.","title":"Open Channel Hydraulics","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"CE3132 Water Resources Engineering or CE4 standing or higher","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CE5312","prereq_tree":"CE3132","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
