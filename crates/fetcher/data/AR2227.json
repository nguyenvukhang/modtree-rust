{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module is the first part of a two-part module introducing students to the history and theory of architecture and urban design. It is shaped around themes grouped by environmental features to emphasize the ways that societies have built in response to the landscapes, resources, and tools available to them. Covering almost two millennia of global architectural and urban history, the module begins in approximately 500 BCE, ending in approximately 1400 CE. The material is presented in such a way as to encourage comparative cross-readings of architectural history between geographies, societies, climates, cultures, religions, and socio-political registers.","title":"History & Theory of Architecture I","department":"Architecture","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"AR2227","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["AR2228"],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
