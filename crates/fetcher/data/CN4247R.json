{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module will start with general introduction about enzyme, enzymatic transformation, and enzymatic process. It will be followed by various components in the development of an enzymatic process enzyme classes and enzymatic reactions; enzyme discovery and high-throughput screening and detection methods; enzyme purification, characterisation, structure, function, and selectivity; protein engineering; cell engineering; biotransformation with isolated enzymes and microbial cells; reaction engineering; enzyme in organic solvent, two-liquid phase system, and enzyme stabilisation; cofactor regeneration; and product recovery. Finally, the students will learn process economics and industrial examples on the enzymatic production of fine chemicals.","title":"Enzyme Technology","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN4247R","prereq_tree":"CN2116","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,2,4]}
