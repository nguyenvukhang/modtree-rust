{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EE5308R","description":"This course provides students with fundamental concepts and methhods for design, measurement, and applications of antennas. Starting with basic antennas (wire, microstrip and aperture antennas), performance-enhanced antennas and their applications such as phased arrays, beamforming, MIMO, and NFC in 5G/RFID/mobile-phones/SatComm/driverless-car radar systems are addressed with practical engnnering considerations. Students will learn the latest methods how to apply fundamentals to the design of antennas to meet the requirements of wireless systems with high efficiency. This specialised module is recommended for graduate students specialising in microwave techniques and wireless systems. This module is supplementary for the general areas of communication systems.","title":"Antenna Engineering","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"[applicable to UG level students only] EE4112; or\n\n[Advisory applicable to GD level students only]: Requires undergraduate 2nd year background knowledge on EM Waves & Fields; and Engineering Maths","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE5308","prereq_tree":"EE4112","fulfill_requirements":["EE6004","EE6832","EE6833"],"workload":[2.5,0.5,0.5,2.5,4.0]}
