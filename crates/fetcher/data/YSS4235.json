{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"How does media enable religious practitioners to experience the divine in\nthe immediacy of the “here and now”? Prayer, liturgy, chanting,\nmeditation, and acts of remembering to commune with higher powers, are\nacts that incorporate audio-visual technologies, t.v., radio, internet,\nreligious texts, art, relics, icons, as well as so-called “idols” and “fetishes.”\nFocusing on the intersection of religion and media, students will analyze\n“sensational forms,” and religious conceptions of how to properly\nrepresent the divine (“semiotic theologies”). By examining media use of\nseveral religious communities around the world, the course highlights\ncritical aspects of religious practice and religious difference.","title":"Religion and the Media Turn","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS4235","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,4.5,5.0]}
