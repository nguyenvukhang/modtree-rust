{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"In this module, students will garner an alternative view of Southeast Asia, where land is pushed to the periphery and water becomes the central element that unites, not divides. Student will examine this maritime region with a line of sight that begins at sea, before traveling upriver to the hinterlands. From an understanding of both fresh and saltwater to an examination of connected people, fauna, cultures and histories, students will explore myriad areas of marine amalgamation; from the Moluccas to Makassar and Madura, through the Tebrau and Melaka Straits, then northwards towards the Mergui Archipelago and into the Mekong.","title":"Southeast Asia by Sea","department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SEA5202","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,4,3]}
