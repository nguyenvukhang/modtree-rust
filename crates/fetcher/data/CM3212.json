{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module covers the chemistry of d-block and f-block metals. An introduction to observed trend in physical and chemical properties of d-block transition metal complexes will be given. A comprehensive discussion on their electronic structures and spectra follows. Magnetic property, ligand substitution and redox reaction of these metal complexes will be illustrated. The f-block metals will be introduced leading to a discussion of the optical spectra of their complexes. Introduction to inorganic supramolecular chemistry, crystal engineering and solid state chemistry will be covered.","title":"Transition Metal Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"CM2111","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CM3212","prereq_tree":"CM2111","fulfill_requirements":["CM4211","CM4212","CM4214","CM4215"],"workload":[3,1,0,3,3]}
