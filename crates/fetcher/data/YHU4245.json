{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Perception is as important as it is puzzling: it is one of our most fundamental ways of knowing about the world, it is prior to thought in some important sense, it is a form of consciousness, and it is a basic source of knowledge. What is perception, and why does it behave in these ways? In this course, we will critically examine one detailed theory of perception, the dual awareness theory. We will also compare this theory to several leading contemporary theories of perception, including representationalism and naive realism.","title":"Perception","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"One Philosophy module other than YCC1113 Philosophy and Political Thought 1 and YCC1114 Philosophy and Political Thought 2 or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU4245","prereq_tree":{"and":["YCC1113","YCC1114"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,4.5]}
