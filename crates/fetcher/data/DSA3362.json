It may be of interest to predict the future values of one set of “output” variables in the data set using the future values of another set of “input” variables. This module introduces students to commonly used techniques in predictive analytics. Topics include: the paradigm of statistical learning, model selection and validation, a set of basic models for learning. Students will gain practical experience applying these techniques to real-world data.","title":"Predictive Data Analytics","department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"DSA3361 Inferential Data Analytics","module_credit":"4","module_code":"DSA3362","prereq_tree":"DSA3361","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,1,3,3]}
