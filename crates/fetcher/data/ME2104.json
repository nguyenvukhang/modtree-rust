{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EG1112","description":"Part II of Engineering Principles and Practice will focus on\nthe engineering principle of how systems are energized\nand controlled and the engineering practice of how they\nare designed, built and valued. Most modern engineering\nsystems are powered electrically. They convert some raw\nform of energy such as fuel (petrol, diesel) or battery\n(electrochemically stored energy), into electrical energy.\nHence energy sources and energy conversion, electrical\nenergy utilization through conversion into various\nfunctions, measurement of functions through their\nperformance parameters will form the backbone of this\nmodule","title":"Engineering Principles and Practice II","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME2104","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["EE4513"],"workload":[3,1,0,0,6]}
