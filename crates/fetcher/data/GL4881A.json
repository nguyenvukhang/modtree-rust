{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module critically examines key literary, philosophical, and political texts in colonial, anticolonial and postcolonial thought through the lens of contemporary globalization. Themes of universality and particularity, the colonizer/colonized relation, the nature of being human, representation and critique, politics and economics, and different visions of how to live in the world will be addressed by careful engagement with primary and secondary texts. Themes will be examined through broader concerns about patterns of global connection, differentiation and belonging. Self-reflection, analysis and critique will be aimed at connecting colonial, anticolonial and postcolonial thought to globalization and how we live in the world.","title":"Colonial, Anticolonial and Postcolonial Globalizations","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GL/GL recognized non-language modules, or 28MCs in SC or 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"GL4881A","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,7.5]}
