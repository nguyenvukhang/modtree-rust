{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"YHU3226 Modern Vietnamese History and Literature","description":"Rebellions and revolutions offer us moments through which to examine both disruptions and continuities in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Vietnamese history. This course studies Vietnam’s past though its own cultural production of knowledge, and it investigates Vietnam’s ethnic minority revolts, anti-colonial rebellions, and the literary revolution of the 1920s and 1930s. The major historical periods covered in this class are territorial expansion, colonization, independence, and war. We will read the political and literary works that emerged during these periods, which include poems, short stories, novels, manifestos, and films. Note the works will be studied in translation.","title":"Rebellion and Revolution in Vietnamese History","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3285","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
