{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Recent years have seen an emergence of ‘critical tourism studies’ focused on tourism’s role in alleviating local problems and addressing global inequalities between countries and communities. Part of this discourse has focused on Asian tourism development and how Asian scholars have interpreted what is critical to their part of the world and the needs of indigenous communities. This module explores how different forms of tourism development are realised in the particularities of Asian socio-cultural, economic, political and intellectual contexts. More specifically, it highlights the significance of Asian realities in defining the scopes and outcomes of tourism changes and knowledge production.","title":"Interpreting Tourism Spaces and Cultures","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before:\nCompleted 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\n(BES students of both specialisations)  \nCompleted 80 MCs of NUS modules before they can read any level-4000 GE modules.
