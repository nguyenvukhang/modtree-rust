{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CS4278","description":"This module introduces the core algorithms and system architectures of intelligent robots. It examines the main system components for sensing, decision making, and motion control and importantly, their integration for core robot capabilities, such as navigation and manipulation. It covers the key algorithms for robot intelligence through inference, planning, and learning, and also provides some practical experiences with modern robot systems. A variety of Illustrative examples are given, e.g., self-driving cars, aerial drones, and object manipulation.","title":"Intelligent Robots: Algorithms and Systems","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS3243 and (MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1508E) and (MA1102R or MA1505 or (MA1511 and MA1512) or MA1521) and (EE2012/A or ST2131 or ST2334)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS5478","prereq_tree":{"and":["CS3243",{"and":[],"or":["MA1101R","MA1311","MA1508E"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1102R","MA1505",{"and":["MA1511","MA1512"],"or":[]},"MA1521"]},{"and":[],"or":["EE2012","EE2012A","ST2131","ST2334"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,5,2]}
