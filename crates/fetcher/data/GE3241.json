{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GE2224","description":"This module explores debates in geography about social issues.  It emphasises the relationship between social identity and social space, and how different places reflect and shape diverse ways of life.  The module examines the role of space in the interplay of different social groups (e.g. ethnic groups, men/women), and in relation to different aspects of daily life (e.g. housing, leisure).  Its emphasis, however, is on how to think about these issues in different scales/contexts (streets, public spaces, global cities).  The course is intended for geography majors, and students throughout NUS with an interest in the relationship between society and space.","title":"Geographies of Social Life","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GE3241","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
