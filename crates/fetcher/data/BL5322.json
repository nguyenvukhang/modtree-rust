{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Studies on biological systems encompasses biotic and abiotic components. Techniques to obtain data from these systems are extremely varied. This module offers insights into current techniques adopted by practitioners in the field of biological conservation and nature-based climate solutions. The module content is especially designed to provide an overview on the necessary tools to quantify abiotic parameters, organisms, interactions, and processes in natural and modified habitats. Field techniques are the crucial first steps in sound study designs to ensure robust datasets for later analyses and interpretation. Core concepts are shared during lectures sessions with hands-on opportunities during fieldtrips","title":"Field Techniques in Biological Conservation","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BL5322","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,2,6]}
