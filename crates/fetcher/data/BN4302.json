{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Cell and tissue bioengineering plays a crucial role in drug development, cancer treatment, and more. Although the mechanical microenvironment of cells is important for many biological processes, existing culture methods are unable to replicate the complex biophysical environment of the body. To address this, the use of organoids, or organ-specific multicellular tissue constructs grown in a supportive \nextracellular matrix, has grown at a rapid pace. This module will explore the role of bioengineering in the discovery, development, and functional exploitation of organoids for broad applications like drug discovery, immunotherapy, and stem cell biology.","title":"Organs in a Dish: Organoid Bioengineering","department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BN4302","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
