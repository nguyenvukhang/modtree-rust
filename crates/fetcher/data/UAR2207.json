{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Intercultural understanding is crucial for solving global problems but face-to-face exchanges are not always possible due to emerging crises, political barriers and income inequality. This module invites students to imagine new modes of intercultural exchange. In the first half of the semester, we will borrow tools and concepts from a variety of disciplines (cultural anthropology, intercultural theatre, interaction design, and translation theory) to devise different “interaction playbooks”. In the second half of the semester we will test these by working with students in partner universities around the world, through digital platforms and, when feasible, face-to-face interactions.","title":"Reinventing Intercultural Exchanges","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","prerequisite":"Not applicable to USP First-Tier modules. \nUSP Advanced modules (Course-Based Modules, CBMs) may state general pre-requisite skills/knowledge.
