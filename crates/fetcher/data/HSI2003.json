{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course examines the evolution of ideas in molecular biology, focusing on approaches to investigations, how these lead to scientific knowledge, and the practices of scientists. Students will learn how the discovery of the DNA structure ultimately led to tools for gene therapy, enabled by the interplay between disciplines beyond molecular biology. Students will embark on mini-projects, and learn how scientists function within communities in the pursuit of major discoveries. This course will equip students with the knowledge and skills needed to understand and evaluate the impact of scientific advances on society and how society in turn shapes scientific endeavours.","title":"From DNA to Gene Therapy","department":"Biochemistry","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","prerequisite":"HSI1000 or SP2274 or equivalent, or module(s) approved by host faculty","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HSI2003","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["HSI1000","SP2274"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,3,3]}
