{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module covers the events and mechanisms leading to the development and differentiation of gonads and sexes in animals and humans, and eventually to the reproduction and propagation of a new generation. It describes the use of invertebrate (Drosophila, C. elegans) and vertebrate models (fish, mouse) in reproduction research, and discusses selected topics to highlight the current trends in animal and human reproduction. This includes new trends in hormonal control of human reproduction (endocrinology), cellular mechanisms and genetic control underlying gonad differentiation, and diseases of the reproductive system.","title":"Reproductive Biology","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"LSM2233","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LSM4252","prereq_tree":"LSM2233","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
