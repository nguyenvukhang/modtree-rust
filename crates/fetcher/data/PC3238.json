{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces fundamental aspects of fluid dynamics, with emphasis on topics relevant to atmospheric and ocean dynamics. The Navier-Stokes equations are derived from first principles. After an introduction to potential flow theory, the study of water waves is taken up to illustrate the behaviour of dispersive wave propagation and nonlinear shock forming tendency. Effects of vertical stratification and rotation on fluid flows are then discussed, and applied to the analysis of atmospheric and ocean flow phenomena. The module closes with an introduction to the theories of turbulence, with application to the atmospheric boundary layer.","title":"Fluid Dynamics","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC2134 or PC2174A or equivalent","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC3238","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["PC2134","PC2174A"]},"fulfill_requirements":["PC3240"],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
