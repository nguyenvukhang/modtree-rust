{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Students will learn the fundamentals, methods and software for formulating and solving optimization problems of relevance to chemical engineering. They will study various methods of linear/nonlinear and unconstrained/constrained programming, which would enable them to select and use appropriate solution algorithm and/or software for solving a given problem. They will also execute the various steps in optimization and demonstrate their acquired knowledge by solving a sufficiently complex practical problem of their own choice in a term project. This is for graduate students who wish to learn optimization methodology to solve real-life problems in research and/or industry.","title":"Optimization of Chemical Processes","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN5111","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,5,2]}
