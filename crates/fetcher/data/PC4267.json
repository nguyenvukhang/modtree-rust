{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module covers the principles of statistics in relation to biophysics and bio soft materials. It focuses on modeling of biomacromolecular structure and statistical complexities; molecular mechanics of biomolecules; statistical models for structural transitions in biopolymers, statistical physical description of structural transitions in macromolecules, simulation of macromolecular structure, structural transitions in polypeptides and proteins; coil-helix transitions; prediction of protein secondary and tertiary structures; statistics of structural transitions in polynucleotides and DNA; modeling of non-regular structures of biomacromolecules. This module is targeted at both physics and non-physics students who already have basic knowledge in physics, thermodynamics and molecular biology.","title":"Biophysics III","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students who have passed either PC3267 or Departmental Approval","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC4267","prereq_tree":"PC3267","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,1,2,3]}
