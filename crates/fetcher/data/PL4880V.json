{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module examines the core topics within cultural psychology using a developmental lens. Two major questions guide the module. First, how do diverse aspects of human development (e.g., emotion, cognition, psychopathology, relationships) converge and diverge across cultures? Second, how may culture shape differential developmental experience and outcomes among people? Focusing on childhood, adolescence, and emerging adulthood, we explore perspectives and critiques of the study of culture within the field of developmental psychology. Emphasis will be on developing an understanding of recent cultural theory, research methods, and critical interpretation of research results.","title":"Culture and Human Development","department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"PL4880V","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.5]}
