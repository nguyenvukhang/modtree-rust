Using the central question, what are the minimum components and processes required to build an artificial living cell from scratch, students will explore how the fundamental chemical and physical principles underlying several biological processes which cells can integrate and function as an autonomous machine to self-replicate, self-assembly, self-repair and reprogram can respond to changes in the environment.","title":"Engineering a Life-like Cell","department":"FoS Dean's Office","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Pass in any two of the following GCE ‘A’-level /H2 subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, either Mathematics or Further Mathematics; or equivalent.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SP2274","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["HSI2003","HSI2002","SP3172","SP3275","HSI2004","HSI2005","HSI2001","HSI2008","HSI2013","HSI2009","HSI2010","HSI2014","HSI2012","HSI2007","HSI2011"],"workload":[2,0,3,3,2]}
