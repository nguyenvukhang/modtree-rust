{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Through the years, the nature of threats has evolved from traditional security, e.g. territorial threats and terrorism, towards hybrid threats, in which state or non-state actors conduct coordinated propaganda, sabotage, pressure, and other overt or covert non-military or military actions to subjugate the target. In this module, students will learn the key concepts of total defence to deal with such threats to a nationâ€™s well-being; identify and articulate a potential hybrid threat to Singapore; and then design, and possibly execute, a community project that could deliver suitable counter-measures that integrate an effective multi-faceted response to the identified threat.","title":"Total Defence Project Against Threat to Community","department":"Office of Sr Dy Pres and Provost","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GEN2002Y","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,4,3]}
