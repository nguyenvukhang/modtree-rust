{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"What defines ‘crime’? How does the likelihood of who commits crime and who is identified as ‘criminal’ differ across social contexts? This module approaches the relationship between crime and society through conceptual categories of class, gender, race, age, and geography drawing on local and global contexts of crime and justice. Students will use inter-disciplinary approaches to learn how institutions, policies, experts and mainstream society shape the landscape of crime, victimisation and justice. Furthermore, they will critically examine whether various formal and informal mechanisms of crime control adequately restore social order or conversely increase recidivism, exacerbate vulnerability and engender inequality.","title":"Crime, Society and Inequality (CSI) Singapore Edition","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTS2412","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
