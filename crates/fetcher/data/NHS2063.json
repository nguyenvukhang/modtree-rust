{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module examines cultural identity of the Bajau Laut, widely known as indigenous sea nomads in Sabah, with attention to the discourses around indigeneity and representation. We will explore topics include the rights of indigenous peoples, the politics of representation, cultural stereotypes and commodification of culture. A 10-weekday study trip to Semporna in summer is integrated with the module where students will have an opportunity to interact with the indigenous community. Students will undertake a documentary project with the community to co-produce new narratives and other creative forms of representation for subverting stereotypes that associated with the stateless Bajau Laut.","title":"Indigeneity and the Politics of Representation in Sabah","department":"NUS College","faculty":"NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NHS2063","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,0,0,6,0]}
