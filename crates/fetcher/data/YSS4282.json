{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Borders appear to be proliferating in today’s globalized world, a supposedly “borderless” world where people, commodities, and finance travel with unprecedented speeds and intensity. There are many different types of borders, ranging from visa regimes to walls, fences, and routine checks of permits. This course asks What are borders? How do they operate? Why are borders hardening amid globalization? Taking a historical and anthropological approach to the study of borders, this course explores how the borders in today’s world trace a genealogy to the modern colonial frontier, the formation of the nation-state, and the neoliberal transformations of labor and economy.","title":"Borders and Boundaries","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS4282","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,7.5,5.0]}
