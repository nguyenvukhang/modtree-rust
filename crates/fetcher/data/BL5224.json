{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Cancers and metabolic diseases including diabetes and obesity are major health issues facing the whole world. The module will examine the various signalling mechanisms that are implicated in the manifestation of the disease processes, the interlink between the different pathways and the identification of potential drug targets.\nThis module will start by focusing on the major signalling pathways that are implicated in cancers and metabolic disorders. Covered topics include cancer-related molecular signalling (the tumor suppressor p53, wnt, TGF-beta signalling and deranged metabolism in cancers) Molecular basis of caners. Also, the cancer stem cells, RNA biology and Drug design for Cancers.","title":"Signalling Mechanisms in Cancers and Metabolic Diseases","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Basic background in molecular biology, calculus and differential equations, and consent of course lecturers.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BL5224","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,1,0,2,3]}
