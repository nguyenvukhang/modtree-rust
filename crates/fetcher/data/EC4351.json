{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course equips students with analytical and empirical tools to understand why the government intervene in the economy and through which mechanism this intervention takes place. We analyse the trade-off faced by the government in designing various public policies, e.g. taxes and subsidies, social protection programs, public good provisions, environmental protection, and healthcare. Theoretical tools are deployed to understand the decision-making process by economic actors and to predict how will they react to the policies. Careful empirical analyses using state-of-the-art methods is discussed to assess these theoretical predictions using the data available in the field.","title":"Public Economics","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in EC, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.
