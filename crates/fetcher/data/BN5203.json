{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"We will investigate various tissue engineering approaches for repair and regeneration of tissue structures and functions. In vivo approaches such as drugs, genes, and cell delivery to stimulate and regulate the biological repair and regeneration mechanisms, and in vitro approaches such as the construction of biodegradable scaffolds to build tissues outside bodies before implantation into patients, will be analyzed.  A few model systems such as liver, heart, nerves, blood vessels, skin, cartilage and bones will be studied. Original literatures will be critically reviewed, presented, and mini-proposals constructed by students in place of CA.","title":"Advanced Tissue Engineering","department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BN5203","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,2,4]}
