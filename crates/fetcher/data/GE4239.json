{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Located at the land-ocean interface, coastal landforms are among the most dynamic landscapes on earth and provide the substrate for 80% of the worldâ€™s population. This module examines the diversity and evolution of different coastal landforms, and the rates and magnitude of coastal change. Focussing on tropical coastal landforms the module uses morphodynamics as an integrating framework to examine process drivers and morphological feedbacks that modulate coastal change across a range of temporal and spatial scales. Knowledge and skills gained in the module provide the science basis that contributes to management of the coast.","title":"Coastal Dynamics","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2020 and before\nCompleted 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 and before\n(BES students from both specialisations)\nCompleted 80 MCs of NUS modules before they can read any level-4000 GE modules.
