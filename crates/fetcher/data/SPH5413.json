{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Investing in the health of women, children and adolescents is critical for every nation’s development. The course applies a life-course perspective to critically explore the issues affecting the health of mothers, young children and adolescents. We will examine the socioeconomic, behavioural and political determinants of maternal, child and adolescent health, as well as policies, programs and services to reach them. The challenges, strategies and potential innovations to more effectively improve their health and wellbeing will be a major focus. These will be linked to global efforts towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to health and well-being, education, gender equity, and poverty reduction.","title":"Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health","department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SPH5413","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
