{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Distressing experiences of hallucinations and delusions might serve as clinical indicators of psychosis, a severe and complex form of mental ill-health. Despite a considerable prevalence of psychotic-like experiences in the general population, individuals with psychiatric diagnoses of schizophrenia would often be exposed to stigma and discrimination in their communities, leading to social disengagement and exclusion. This module aims to equip students with introductory empirical, academic, and clinical knowledge related to cognitive understanding of hallucinations and delusions. It will provide a normalising, destigmatising, depathologising, socially inclusive, and compassionate evidence-based framework to reflect on and formulate experiences of psychosis.","title":"Hallucinations and Delusions: A Cognitive Perspective","department":"Psychology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, of which students must have passed PL1101E, PL2131, PL2132, and 4 out of the 5 core modules (PL3232/PL3102 â€“ PL3236/PL3106), which must include PL3236/PL3106, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"PL4248","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,7.5]}
