{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module discusses the adverse effects and action mechanisms of food-associated compounds on human health. It also covers the basic chemical and biological principles of toxicology, including modes of actions of toxic compounds, factors that affect the toxicological potential of toxic compounds, route of exposure, and dose-response effects. It will focus on the food-associated compounds, including synthetic chemicals (for example, food additives and contaminants), naturally occurring food compounds (for example, plant or animal toxins), and compounds that are produced during food production and storage (for example, aflatoxins and other carcinogens).","title":"Advanced Food Toxicology and Chemical Safety","department":"Food Science and Technology","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"FST5206","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
