Through exploring a range of practical approaches deployed by some key practitioners in the field, students are guided to think critically about how the social efficacy of theatre can be promoted and debated. Leading approaches are re-examined in light of context‐ and culture‐specific situations, and students' practical experience form a basis to engage with theoretical questions and issues of creating participatory theatre in non‐conventional settings.","title":"Applied Theatre","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"TS1101E or GEM1003","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TS3222","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["TS1101E","GEM1003"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
