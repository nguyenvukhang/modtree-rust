{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module helps students to critically understand the unmet needs and issues of marginalised communities (e.g. the elderly and the disabled). It does this by providing students with opportunities to actively engage with a selected community, and to study its challenges in-depth. Students will be equipped with the basic concepts and skills of research and evaluation to study the communityâ€™s programmes and policies. They will apply the knowledge they acquire in the classroom to real-world situations through group projects and collaborations with a community partner.","title":"Understanding Communities: Theory & Practice","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTS2407","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,6,4]}
