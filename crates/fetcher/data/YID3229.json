{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course explores how communities and institutions are proactively responding to the climate crisis, and what types of tactics are being successful in creating climate resilient and regenerative businesses and communities. The course also interrogates and analyzes various motivations of climate activists, with a focus on those in Asia, including youth activists, seeking to understand their motivations and tactical choices; and will also engage with literature on climate social movements and activism, broadly. An analysis of various literary sources on climate emotions will contextualise their – and, indeed, our own – strategies for dealing with climate anxiety and grief and, equally, for nurturing climate hope.","title":"Climate Hope and Resiliency","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YID3229","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1.0,0.0,0.0,3.0,8.5]}
