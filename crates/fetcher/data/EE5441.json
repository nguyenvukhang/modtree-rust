{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"Not required","description":"As devices scale down, quantum effects become important when their size reaches the nanometer regime. Devices with nanometer features exhibit properties different from conventional bulk devices. The making of nano-devices, e.g., single electron transistor, nanoscale transistor, spintronic devices, etc., has been made possible by advanced nano-fabrication techniques. This module aims to provide an introductory coverage on the quantum and solid state physics and principles that form the basis of operation of nanoelectronics and emerging devices with an emphasis on charge and spin transport. Topics covered include basic concepts of quantum mechanics, principle of nanoeletronics, spin transport, advanced materals, and nano-devices.","title":"Introduction to Nanoelectronics and Emerging Devices","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Requires background such as EE4435 Modern Transistors and Memory Devices","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE5441","prereq_tree":"EE4435","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
