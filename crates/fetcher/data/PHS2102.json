Theory of drug-receptor binding and impact on drug action and design will be exemplified with pharmaceutically relevant and clinically approved drug products to illustrate the application of fundamental knowledge of cellular and biochemical processes in drug target identification and pharmacophore optimization. Completion of this module will further prepare students for future modules on biopharmaceutics, drug metabolism and strategic development of pharmaceutical drug products.","title":"Physicochemical and Biochemical Principles of Drug Action","department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PHS1101 The Billion-Dollar Pill â€“ Bench to Bedside Drug Development","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PHS2102","prereq_tree":"PHS1101","fulfill_requirements":["PHS2191"],"workload":[2,3,0,1,4]}
