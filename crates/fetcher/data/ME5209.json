{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module is designed to give an overview and selected deep-dives of different energy conversion systems. It comprises three main parts â€“ (is) renewable technologies and conventional energy/power systems, (ii) different fuel uses for reduction of carbon emission, (iii) energy/power distribution systems and (iv) life cycle cost analysis. Firstly, the module introduces renewable systems including solar, wind, geothermal, hydropower, biomass, and fossil-fuel driven energy conversion systems. In addition to electric energy systems, different thermal energy generation systems will be introduced. Secondly, electric energy systems with different fuel uses for current and future will be analysed. Thirdly, students will learn about energy distribution systems (both electric and thermal) and the changes that arise from distributed generation of renewable energies. Finally, the long-term economic viability will be discussed.","title":"Energy Technologies and Systems","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME5209","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,2,5]}
