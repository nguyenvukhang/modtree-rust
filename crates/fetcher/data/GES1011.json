{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"SSA2211, GESS1009","description":"Histories of Singapore have conventionally been narrated along internal lines, framed by administrative, political and national trajectories. Yet, the evolution of Singapore, from regional emporium to imperial port and strategic naval base, has all along been defined by much larger regional and transoceanic forces. Even after political independence in 1965, Singapore continues to project itself as a 'global city-state'. This module seeks to examine the historical evolution of Singapore against the contexts of global changes and developments from the 14th to the 21st century. This module is open to all students interested in Singapore studies.","title":"The Evolution of a Global City-State","department":"History","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GES1011","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
