{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module will give students sound knowledge and appreciation of the development of plant-wide control (PWC) systems for chemical processes. The course will cover the systematic design of a regulatory control system with the aid of heuristics and computer-aided simulation tools. Students will be introduced to dynamic (real-time) simulation of chemical processes. Active learning techniques will be employed throughout. As part of the assessment, students will get to work hands-on with a project to design and simulate PWC systems for a chemical plant. Students are also assessed by means of a class test, and small individual assignments.","title":"Control of Industrial Processes","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"CN3121: Process Dynamics and Control","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN4221R","prereq_tree":"CN3121","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2.5,1.0,0.0,3.5,3.0]}
