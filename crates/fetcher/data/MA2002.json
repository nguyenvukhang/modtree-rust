We will introduce precise definitions of limit, continuity, derivative, and the Riemann integral. Students will be exposed to computational techniques and applications of differentiation and integration. This course concludes with an introduction to first order differential equations. Major topics Functions; limit and continuity; derivative; Intermediate Value Theorem; chain rule; implicit differentiation; higher derivatives; Mean Value Theorem; Riemann integral; Fundamental Theorem of Calculus; elementary transcendental functions and their inverses; techniques of integration; computation of area, volume and arc length using definite integrals; first order differential equations.","title":"Calculus","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"GCE ‘A’ Level or H2 Mathematics or H2 Further Mathematics or MA1301 or MA1301FC or MA1301X","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MA2002","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["MA1301","MA1301FC","MA1301X"]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS4248","BT2101","BT4240","IS4242","BT3104","MA2108","MA2108S","MA2213","MA2219","MA2311","DSA2102","MA2104","MA2116","ST2334","DSA3361"],"workload":[3,1,1,0,5]}
