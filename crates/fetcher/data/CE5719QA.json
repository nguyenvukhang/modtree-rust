{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CE5719A","description":"This module introduces design principles for fixed ocean infrastructure to harvest the offshore wind energy, which represents a most popular renewable energy resource in the ocean since 1990s. With the technological advancement and plans for deployment further offshore, the design of the support structures for offshore wind turbines becomes increasingly challenging. This module covers the basic design principles for the support structures of the offshore wind turbines through the limit state concepts, anchored on the state-of-the-art engineering practices and engineering guidelines. The module will allow students to develop capabilities in designing fixed structures supporting the next-generation harvesting offshore wind turbines.","title":"Design of Fixed Wind Turbine Structures","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Background in structural mechanics","module_credit":"2","module_code":"CE5719QA","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,2,0]}
