{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces techniques through which dynamic environmental conditions can be measured and monitored and provides a basis for reasoned debates about issues related to environmental change. Students following the module can expect to be tutored in a number of techniques that may include (depending upon expertise of staff who are available to teach the module) geomorphic hazard mapping, micro-meteorology, palaeoecology and remote sensing. The module goes on to discuss the implications to humans of past and present environmental dynamism and of predicted environmental changes. Among the topics for student-led discussions in this part of the module are the dialectic of global climate change; the contribution of urban areas to global climate change; possible relationships between biodiversity and environmental instability; and inequalities in the degree of human vulnerability. A seminar presentation focusing on the relevance of the module to their thesis or on thesis topic is expected.","title":"Dynamic Environments","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GE5211","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,2,0,5,2]}
