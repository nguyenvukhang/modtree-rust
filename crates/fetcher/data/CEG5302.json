{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course explores how principles from theories of evolution can be used to construct intelligent systems. Established evolutionary paradigms as well as, significant new developments, including evolutionary algorithms, evolutionary strategies, ant-colony optimization, swarm intelligence and multi-objective evolutionary optimization techniques will be covered. Students will be taught how these approaches identify and exploit biological processes in nature, allowing a wide range of applications to be solved in industry and business. Key problem domains such as multi-objective scheduling, optimization, search, and design will be examined. Students will gain hands-on experience in applying these techniques to real-life application-oriented problems through project work.","title":"Evolutionary Computation and Applications","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5302","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
