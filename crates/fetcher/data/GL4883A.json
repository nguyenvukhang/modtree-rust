{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module examines the role of natural resource endowments and scarcity in national and international conflicts. The course begins with a review of causes of conflict and develops an understanding of how these causes may be linked to natural resource endowments. We then explore how constraints on natural resources such as water and fertile soil increase the potential of environmentally linked violence. Students will explore not only conflict theory, concepts of greed and grievance, and scarcity, but also technical aspects of global environmental change. Finally, the class will explore potential conflict resolution approaches.","title":"Conflict and Natural Resources","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non‚Äêlanguage modules or 28 MCs in PS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"GL4883A","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,7.5]}
