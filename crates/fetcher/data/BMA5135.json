{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Adapting to the ongoing digitization of the economy, and of society in general, is arguably the most challenging transformation every business is currently facing. Digital technologies have become the core of almost every industry. Rapidly advancing technologies and digital trends, changing customer behaviours, and disruptive competitors are making it increasingly difficult for organisations to drive sustainable and profitable growth. CEOs report that many of their digital transformation efforts fail and our research is showing that up to 70% of organisations failed to exceed their return on digital investment goals. Leaders are well aware of the need to transform but are desperately in need of direction as to how to change and even where change is required. This specific course will focus on execution of digital strategy in the “real world” and equip students with some of the tools to be kept in mind in this rapidly changing paradigm.","title":"Execution of Digital Strategy in the real world","department":"BIZ Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BMA5135","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,0,0,2,4]}
