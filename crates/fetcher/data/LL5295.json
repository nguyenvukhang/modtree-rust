{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"LL4295V/LL5295V/LL6295V Conflict of Laws in Int’l Commercial Arbitration","description":"This course will focus in detail on the instances in which resort to conflict of laws is necessary in the international arbitration context. The objective of this course is to allow participants to realise on how many occasions both State courts and arbitrators will need to report a conflict of laws analysis despite the claim that conflict of laws issues are not relevant in the international commercial arbitration context. Participants will first be taught to identify what conflict of laws rules may apply and will then be given hypothetical cases and will be asked to critically examine whether a solution can be found that does not require a conflict of laws approach.","title":"Conflict of Laws in Int’l Commercial Arbitration","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LL5295","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,0,7]}
