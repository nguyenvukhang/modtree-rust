{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This advanced module presents the fundamentals of classical electrodynamics in much depth. It covers the following topics: relativistic formulation of the electromagnetic field, covariance of electrodynamics, conservation laws, radiation by moving charges, Lienard-Wiechert potentials, Larmor's formula, angular distribution of radiation, spectral properties of radiation, Cherenkov radiation, Bremsstrahlung, synchrotron radiation, multipole expansions, and applications. A good mathematical foundation is required.","title":"Electricity and Magnetism III","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC3231","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC4242","prereq_tree":"PC3231","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
