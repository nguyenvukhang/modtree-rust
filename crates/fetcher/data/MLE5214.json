{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MLE4202 Selected advanced Topics on Polymers","description":"This module provides a foundation for students interested\nin doing research into polymeric materials. It starts with\nthe thermoplastics, elastomers and thermosets.\nApplication of polymers as membranes will be presented,\nparticularly their application for water purification and gas\nseparation. Photoresists that are essential materials in\nelectronic industry will be included. Two display\ntechnologies, liquid crystal displays and organic lightemitting\ndiodes will be introduced. Advanced polymers,\nincluding liquid crystalline polymers, semiconductive\npolymers and conductive polymers, will be discussed. The\nmodule will finish with aspects of current research on\npolymeric materials.","title":"Advances in Polymeric Materials","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MLE5214","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.5,0.0,0.0,6.5]}
