{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CS4230","description":"The aim of this module is to study the various measures of difficulty of problem solving in computing, and to introduce some techniques in theoretical computer science such as non-determinism, digitalisation, simulation, padding, reduction, randomisation and interaction. Topics covered include: space and time complexity - the classes P, NP, co-NP, PSPACE, EXP, etc.; tape compression; linear speedup; polynomial reduction; Cook's theorem; Savitch's theorem; translation lemma; Gap theorem; NP-completeness and NP-hard problems; probabilistic complexity classes; approximation algorithms; and interactive protocols.","title":"Computational Complexity","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS4232 Theory of Computation","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS5230","prereq_tree":"CS4232","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
