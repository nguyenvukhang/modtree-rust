{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The SG Botanic Gardens, chicken rice, and pinisi boats - heritage is part of our lives, emotional attachments, memories, and identities. Because of its ubiquitous\nsignificance, heritage is also mobilized to facilitate international dialogue or legitimate shifts in geo-political landscapes. But whose heritage is invoked where\ninternational alliances and boundaries are concerned? How to make sense of competing heritage claims? This interdisciplinary, experiential course draws on\npolitics, international affairs, heritage, geography and history in order to interrogate the geopolitical and economic significance of heritage. Combining theory and\npractice, the course also invites students to conceptualize individual “geopolitics of heritage” projects.","title":"Geopolitics of Heritage","department":"LKYSPP Dean's Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PP5534","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,5,3]}
