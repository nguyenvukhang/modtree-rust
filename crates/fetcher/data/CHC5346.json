{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course examines representations of various kinds of labour in modern Chinese literature, cinema, and art, and how they variedly obscure and reveal tensions between the productive economy and cultural production. The course introduces students to major theories of labour in social and cultural critiques, alongside primary works (1960s-present) from the PRC, Taiwan, and Malaysia that variously complicate relations between the politico-social aspects of labour, and how labour appears in aesthetic representations. Topics include cultural work; gender and sexuality; rural-urban migration in poetry and prose; rights-based documentary vs. short video-forms; internet literature; cinema and digital media; social media; subculture.","title":"\"How We Work\" in Modern Chinese Literature and Media","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CHC5346","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,5,5]}
