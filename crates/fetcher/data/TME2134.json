{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"TM1131, ME2134E","description":"This is an introductory course to fluid mechanics for mechanical engineering students. After introducing the basic terminology and a classification of fluid flows, students are taught fluid statics, which covers hydrostatic forces on submerged bodies and buoyancy. In the section on fluid dynamics, basic principles of fluid motion are introduced. This covers the continuity equation, Bernoulli and energy equations. The momentum equation and its engineering application using the control volume approach are included. Dimensional analysis and similitude are taught with engineering examples. This course also includes laminar and turbulent pipe flows, Hagen-Poiseuille law, friction factor, and losses in pipe fittings.","title":"Fluid Mechanics I","department":"SCALE Dean's Office","faculty":"Cont and Lifelong Education","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TME2134","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["TME2135"],"workload":[3.0,1.0,0.5,0.0,5.5]}
