{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module will give students the opportunity to engage creatively with society through the lens of contemporary art, with a focus on “the art world” and international exhibition-making. How do artists deal with exhibiting in different contexts like galleries, artist-run spaces, museums, public space, and biennials? The aim is for students to become familiar with diverse methods of exhibiting, by studying shows like Documenta15 and the 59th Venice Biennial to analyze multi-facetted approaches to curatorial and artistic practice. We will discuss the conditions and opportunities of art in society, while working through our individual practices towards a collaborative exhibition project.","title":"Situations (Contemporary Art in Today’s Society)","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3376","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,6.5]}
