{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CS3244","description":"This module covers the fundamental concepts, theory,\nand algorithms in machine learning, and a variety of\nmodeling techniques to extract information from raw data.\nThe class will cover topics in both supervised and\nunsupervised learning, including problems in classification\nand regression, computational learning theory,\nreinforcement learning, probabilistic inference, ensemble\nlearning, and more advanced topics. The class will cover\nboth the underlying mathematical tools, as well as\npractical frameworks for solving real-world problems. At\nthe end of the course, students are expected to be familiar\nwith the theories and paradigms of computational learning,\nand capable of implementing basic learning systems.","title":"Foundations of Machine Learning","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS2109S and CS2040/S/C and (MA1101R or MA2001 or MA1311 or MA1513 or MA1508E) and (EE2012/A or MA2216 or MA2116 or ST2131 or ST2334 )","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS3264","prereq_tree":{"and":["CS2109S",{"and":[],"or":["CS2040","CS2040C"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1101R","MA2001","MA1311","MA1513","MA1508E"]},{"and":[],"or":["EE2012","EE2012A","MA2216","MA2116","ST2131","ST2334"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS6284"],"workload":[2,1,0,4,3]}
