Conflict interfaces with mutual\ndependence naturally, and decision making in such situations requires one to take into account the moves and countermoves among them. This module provides a\nrigorous non-cooperative game theoretic view for managers to analyse rational decision makings under various conjectural behaviours in such strategic interactions together with strategic moves to possibly influence the outcome for oneâ€™s own or mutual gains. Fundamental theory will be well balanced with economic, managerial and personal decision making situation applications. Game experiments will be performed as well.","title":"Game Theory For Managers","department":"BIZ Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BMS5117","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
