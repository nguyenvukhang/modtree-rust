Navigating these complex negotiations requires one to be conscious of the psychological,\nhistorical, sociological, economical, and other contextual factors that shape each unique encounter. The rapid advancement in science and technology\nadds to the challenge of interpreting highly technical, domain‚Äêspecific information, which is critical in rationalizing decisions and persuading counterparts.
