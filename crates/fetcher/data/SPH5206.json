Students will learn about constraints and vulnerabilities in our physico-social ecology, and how to balance the natural tropical biosphere and man-made technosphere in the face of climate, economic and lifestyle changes. Risk assessment and management form the basis for health protection, safeguarding against emergent threats, and skills-building in risk communications promotes right attitudes and behaviours for community wellbeing. This module provides a combination of hard and soft science approaches that will guide field epidemiologists in urban health security.","title":"Urban Field Epidemiology","department":"SSH School of Public Health Dean's Office","faculty":"SSH School of Public Health","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SPH5206","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,4,3]}
