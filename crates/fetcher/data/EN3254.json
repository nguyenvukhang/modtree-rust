{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This interdisciplinary module explores experimental intersections between visual art and literature, in non-Western contexts. Lectures and readings will draw on the history and theory of both fields. Starting from the contested frame of a ‘global modernism’, the module addresses tensions between cultural nationalism and internationalism, modernity and tradition, realism and abstraction, through the progressive and cosmopolitan visions of artists and writers. What is at stake for Asian intellectuals at the boundaries between art forms? A range of case studies will encompass both literary treatments of images, and visual treatments of the written word in e.g., concretism, conceptualism, translation and adaptation.","title":"Worldly Words: Written Image and Visual Text","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"(i) EN1101E AND (ii) at least one of the following modules (EN2201, EN2202, EN2203, EN2204, EN2205, EN2206, EN2207, EN2275, EN2276, EN2277)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EN3254","prereq_tree":{"and":["EN1101E",{"and":[],"or":["EN2201","EN2202","EN2203","EN2204","EN2205","EN2206","EN2207","EN2275","EN2276","EN2277"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,3,7]}
