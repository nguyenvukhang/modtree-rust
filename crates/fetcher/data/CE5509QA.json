This module provides participants with approaches in designing structural components and buildings using steel and its use to enhance buildability and productivity in prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC). The participants will acquire fundamental knowledge and skills to perform design for structural elements and ensure the stability of steel structures. This enables the participants to conceive a safe and economical structural system using steel to improve productivity for the construction industry of Singapore.\n\nThe module is targeted at practicing engineers and postgraduate civil engineering students with a keen interest on structural steel design including the design for manufacturing and disassembly (DfMA) using PPVC technology.","title":"Advanced Structural Steel Design","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Background in Structural Steel Design","module_credit":"2","module_code":"CE5509QA","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,1,6]}
