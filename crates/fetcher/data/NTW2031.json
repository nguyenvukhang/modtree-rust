{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module teaches writing and critical thinking by exploring questions about an activity all students are immersed in education. It is one of the main ways of acquiring knowledge, it shapes the frameworks with which new information is processed, and it leads to improved qualities of life. We discuss the goals of education, the nature of education, and how education intersects with inequality. This course gives students the ability to critically reflect on their own educational goals, apply useful epistemological concepts to their own experiences, and interrogate beliefs about the role education does and should play in our society.","title":"Equity and Education","department":"NUS College Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NTW2031","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,0,0,3,3]}
