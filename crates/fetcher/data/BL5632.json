{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Large genomic data sets are ubiquitous in modern biotechnology studies, and so large computing problems are increasingly handled using cloud computing instead of desktop workstations. This module will develop skills for genomic data analysis using realistic problems in analysing drug action and target validation studies. The working environment will be in the programming language R and cloud-based Amazon Machine Instances (AMIs) running Linux.","title":"Genomic Data Science in the Cloud","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"BL5631 Practical Genomic Data Analysis using R","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BL5632","prereq_tree":"BL5631","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,2,3,2]}
