{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module will familiarise students with recent deep learning tools and their application to robotics, in particular deep reinforcement learning (RL). The first part of this module focuses on the fundamental mathematical background to RL, from Markov Decision Processes (MDP) all the way to Q-learning. Students will then dive into deep learning methods and their application to a variety of core robotics problem: control, perception, manipulation, path planning, and multirobot collaboration. This module includes mandatory assignments and a compulsory group project. This module is intended for graduate students and engineers interested in deep (reinforcement) learning and its applications to real-world robotics tasks.","title":"Deep Learning for Robotics","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME5406","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
