But how is water regulated when it crosses national borders? And how is it regulated when it is found underground? Can water in one country be of relevance for the international community as a whole? These are some of the questions that will be discussed in the intensive course on International Water Law. Throughout three weeks students will focus on transboundary surface water (first week), transboundary aquifers (second week) and on three specific water related matters that link water with other key relevant international legal areas (third week): climate change, sustainable development and security.","title":"International Water Law","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or equivalent.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LL6449","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,0,7]}
