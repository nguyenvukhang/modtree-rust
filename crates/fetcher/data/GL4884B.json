{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"In this module, we will explore the diversity of ways people use infrastructures, and the various social meanings people ascribe them. We will reconsider formal understandings of infrastructure to question how infrastructures perform unexpected roles in societyâ€”perhaps as tools for social identity or community formation. We will also pay particular attention to processes and experiences of globalization through infrastructure. For example how do transoceanic undersea cable networks affect life on their island landing zones? Students will also develop their research skills by working on an ethnography of infrastructure.","title":"Living with Infrastructure","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"GL4884B","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,4.5]}
