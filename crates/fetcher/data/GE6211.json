{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module familiarizes students with advanced spatial data science techniques and literature in the emerging field of digital geography. Topics examined include \nspatiotemporal data mining, geospatial simulation, spatial statistics and machine learning techniques, and spatial data quality. Upon completion of the module, students will be expected to be able to apply these spatial data science techniques to their field(s) of interest, and critically assess the analysis outcomes and implications to human everyday life and the physical environment. Students are required to undertake an independent project, and their work will be presented in a seminar format.","title":"Spatial Data Science","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"GE5223 Introduction to Applied GIS","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GE6211","prereq_tree":"GE5223","fulfill_requirements":["GE6225","GE6226"],"workload":[1,0,3,4,2]}
