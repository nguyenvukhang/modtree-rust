{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module examines the new development of Taoism in the third century when China entered into a period of political disunity for centuries to come. New interests in the dark mysteries of the universe and solid groundings (if any) of human flourishing and happiness came to the forefront. Classical Taoism was given a new twist as Confucian ideas were subtly assimilated and is often called “Neo‐Taoism”. The module focuses on the critical reading of some foundational commentaries on the Laozi and the Zhuangzi and illustrates how Neo‐Taoism is different from its predecessor in early China.","title":"Neo‐Taoism","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"All graduates in our new Master’s program.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CHC5315","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,5,5]}
