{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Do we need to make radical changes to our values in response to the environmental crisis? How about to our lifestyles? And how can we teach people, both adults and young people, to better care for the environment? Responding to the environmental crises we now face will require changes to how we produce energy, construct buildings, and manufacture products. Many suggest that they also require deeper changes, to what we value and how we live. This course focuses on these deeper changes, on whether they are necessary, and on how they may be effected through policy and education.","title":"Wild and Simple:  Living and Thinking Sustainably","department":"NUS College","faculty":"NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NTW2034","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,0,0,3,3]}
