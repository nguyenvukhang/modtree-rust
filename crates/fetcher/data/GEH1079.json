Why were defenceless unarmed people killed by armed forces? The word now used to define this theme is ‘non-combatant.’ But neither word nor concept is primordial, or was universal.

It evolved historically, and not in any straight line. This course will ask the direct questions: how, why and to what ends?","title":"Whatever it takes?
