This module explores the various genres of keyboard music throughout history, acknowledging the composers who have gained widespread popularity, while simultaneously delving into the works of those who have received less attention. Topics covered include variation sets, preludes, fugues, suites, studies, and single-movement works. Students will think critically about the significance and evolution of each genre over time, and emerge with a fuller picture of music written for the keyboard and a curiosity to continue discovering and rediscovering this repertoire.","title":"Keyboard Literature: Genres throughout History","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"BMus students, and non-YST NUS students who are able to read Western Classical music notation fluently (particularly in bass and treble clefs).
