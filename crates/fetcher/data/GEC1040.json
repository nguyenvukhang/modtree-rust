{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GEK1522/GEK1522T/GEH1025/GEH1025T Global Environmental Issues","description":"Cultures influence how sustainability issues are viewed and addressed in different contexts and situations. They determine the ways in which environmental, social, and economic considerations connect to sustainability and sustainable urban development. Success in our global sustainability efforts depends on our understanding of the underlying cultures and the connections between them, particularly in the face of urbanisation. This module aims to raise our studentsâ€™ awareness of these issues and to equip them with the critical thinking and collaborative decision-making skills necessary to find solutions to local and global problems of societal concern. Appropriate cross-cultural case studies will be discussed.","title":"A Culture of Sustainability","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GEC1040","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
