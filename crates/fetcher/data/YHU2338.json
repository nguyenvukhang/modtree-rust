{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"It is an empirical fact that we routinely comply with a variety of social norms, follow many social conventions and obey a multitude of laws. But, what are social norms? How are they distinct from other constraints on individual or group behaviour? What explains norm compliance? How do norms emerge? Why do norms persist over time? Why does normative fracture happen? This course attempts to answer these questions by bringing together insights, about the structure, functions and evolution of social norms, from different disciplines in the social sciences in a philosophically â€“ minded survey.","title":"Social Norms: A Philosophical Introduction","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU2338","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.5,6.0]}
