{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module will provide a basis for a close study of the foundations of the study of South Asia, particularly in the three areas around which the Programme operates: historical and political; cultural and religious; and social and economic.  It will look closely at the work of major figures in order to provide an understanding of important shifts in the study of the region.  These studies will include work on historical writing in colonial and postcolonial times, the rise of village studies, the development of the significant scholarly work on South Asian religions and caste, and the nature of the colonial and postcolonial economies of the region. Thus, the module will provide a basis for understanding the literature in the three areas of study and the major advances that have taken place in the study of South Asia.","title":"Approaches to the Study of South Asia","department":"South Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SN, or 28 MCs in SC or 28 MCs in GL or GL recognised non-language modules with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in SN, or 28 MCs in SC with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"SN4101","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,6.5]}
