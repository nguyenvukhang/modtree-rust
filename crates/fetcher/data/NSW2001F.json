{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The social world and how it’s experienced is complex and mediated by one’s social identity, interpersonal relationships, and broader social forces. This module \nexplores how social scientists approach the study of social norms, relations, and institutions as experienced by different groups and how they interact and intersect, \ninfluencing each other. In investigating these complexities, students analyse these interactions and their consequences and develop critical perspectives on the social world. Singapore will feature as a key case study to be compared globally with other societies and students will gain a deeper understanding of Singapore and other societies undergoing rapid change.","title":"Understanding the Social World: Singapore & Beyond","department":"NUS College Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NSW2001F","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,4,0,2,4]}
