{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Geography increasingly relies on empirical data to understand social and environmental phenomena. This module will build a foundation for applied data analysis, emphasizing the fundamental data science tasks of wrangling, visualization, and analysis. Each of these tasks requires an understanding of quantitative approaches to generate and evaluate hypotheses. As such, the module will also cover essential concepts in statistics including expectation, hypothesis testing, and regression. By the end of the module, students will have a strong foundation to analyze multivariate data and communicate findings using open-source programming tools.","title":"Applied Geographical Data Science","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GE3259","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,2,3,3]}
