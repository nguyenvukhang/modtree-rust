{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Ideas and concepts derived from European experience—anarchy, sovereignty, balance of power, and so forth—dominate thinking about world order. This module challenges this dominance by problematising European narratives and by examining extra-European approaches. Particular attention will be given to thematic issues, such as empire and race, as well as Asian, Islamic, and Pan-African understandings of world order. Consideration will also be given to the adequacy of European ideas and concepts, and to alternative vocabularies of world order. The module is historical and philosophical in orientation, with theoretical questions being at the centre of inquiry.","title":"World Orders","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PS3312","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
