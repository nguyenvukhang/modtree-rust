Studying Singapore with global comparisons, we examine four arenas of public culture negotiations the cultural framing of places and their exclusions; urban spectacles and rituals as symbolic expressions of communal and civic identities; museumsâ€™ roles in shaping or challenging popular opinion on identities; and media portrayals and interpretations of urban cultures.","title":"The City and Public Culture","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"NM4254","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,6.5,6.0]}
