Coaching sessions provide in-depth insight into the specific piece(s) chosen for study; whilst active participation is expected in the studio class, which provides an overview of the most significant works relevant to the genre. Students must participate in a public, assessed performance as the final examination of the prepared work(s); and to reflect upon their learning process in the context of this module by updating their e-portfolios.","title":"Collaborative Piano - Piano Ensemble","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"MUA1112","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MUA2240","prereq_tree":"MUA1112","fulfill_requirements":["MUA3240"],"workload":[2.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,7.5]}
