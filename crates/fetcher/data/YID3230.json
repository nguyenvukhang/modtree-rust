{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Since 1839, Pacific Asia has undergone a socio-ecological transformation whose turbulence and implications are world-historically unprecedented. Drawing on fields such as environmental sociology, political economy, and critical development studies, the module examines the region’s violent insertion into the capitalist world-system in the wake of the Opium Wars and its subsequent unfolding under Japanese colonialism, US ‘developmentalism’, and Asian Stalinism. While the focus is on northeast Asian hegemonic dynamics, the module contextualises the ambivalence of the new qualitative trajectory in nature-society relations that was forged during this period, especially in “newly industrialised countries” like Singapore and South Korea.","title":"Asia, Development, and Environment","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YID3230","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,6.5,6.0]}
