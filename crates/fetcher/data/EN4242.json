This survey course provides a comprehensive understanding of major critical theories of the twentieth century post-structuralism and discourse-analysis, psychoanalysis, twentieth-century Marxism, and post-colonial studies. Close readings of Foucault, Lacan and Adorno in particular, will equip students to engage in wide-ranging and sometimes complex debates about critical approaches to the study of cultural meaning, its production and interpretation.
