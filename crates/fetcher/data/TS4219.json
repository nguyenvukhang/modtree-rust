{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module examines popular media-mediated events \"as\" performance.  The module will investigate the way in which 'mediatised'(i.e. media-mediated) and popular events \"perform\" and shape the audience's perception of reality.  Conversely, the module will also examine how media-mediated performance is influenced by audience interests and perceptions.  The focus will be on popular media-mediated events like sports, reality TV, the internet to illustrate how they constitute different modes of performances while sharing similar performativities.  The module will also focus on cross-genre, inter-disciplinary performances while also examining notions of the spectacular and spectacle in contemporary visual culture.","title":"Media and Popular Performance","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"TS4219","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,6.5]}
