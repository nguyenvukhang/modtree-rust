{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"- Application Development Project\nThis is a pre-internship project where the students will work in a team to apply the project management, analysis, design, business communications and programming skills learnt earlier in the course. Based on a User Requirement Statement given to the students, they will go through a complete software development life cycle to develop and deliver the required system. The students will capture requirements through user interviews, produce a feasible design of the system, code, test and implement the solution in a distributed platform. This project provides a simulation of the real-life IT working environment, and tests their strengths in working closely as a project team.","title":"AD Project","department":"Institute of Systems Science","faculty":"Institute of Systems Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"6","module_code":"SA4106","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,15,0]}
