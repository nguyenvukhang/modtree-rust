{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module explores how law is meant to mediate risk. But with every law passed that is meant to protect society, a right is restricted. Thus, this module will explore how law is made and the fine line between what is gained and what is lost when a law is passed. Three domains will be examined the legislature, the courts, and the police. Students will have the opportunity to examine specific legal cases and interact with the institutions that handle these cases. Traditional lectures will be replaced with in-class discussions, field trips, and guest lectures with law and policy makers.","title":"Law in the Making:  From Protecting to Policing Society","department":"NUS College","faculty":"NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NHS2059","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,0,0,6,0]}
