{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MA2104 Multivariable Calculus or MA1507 Advanced Calculus","description":"Calculus is the study of rates of changes and provides a framework for modelling systems and to find the effect of changing conditions of the systems being investigated. However, some of the most interesting systems cannot be modelled using just one variable.\nThe aim of this module is to extend the knowledge of Calculus (YSC1216) to more complex systems, studying the rate of change, volumes and optimization for functions in more than one variable.\nThis module gives the needed tools to apply knowledge of advanced calculus in Physical Sciences, Life Science, Economics and Statistics.","title":"Multivariable Calculus","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC1216 Calculus or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC2252","prereq_tree":"YSC1216","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,4.0,0.0,3.0,5.5]}
