{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module is designed for biology students who have no or limited prior background in bioinformatics. Students will learn state-of-the art computational approaches to analyse large sets of genomic, transcriptomic, epigenomic and proteomic data. They will be further introduced to recent machine learning\ndevelopments and their applications to molecular genetics. Lectures from specialists will be complemented by tutorials to help the students to take advantage of public computational resources (databases and analysis software). At the end of the course, students will be able to apply these computational resources to their own projects.","title":"Computational genomics","department":"NUS Medicine Dean's Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CDM5104","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,3,0,3,1]}
