{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module provides an introduction to machine learning and data mining methods for economics problems. The module will explain the core concept\nof well‚Äêknown supervised learning algorithms including decision trees, neural networks, and support vector machines. Differences between these methods and econometrics methods will be discussed. This module will move on to explain unsupervised learning methods. Emerging topics, such as time series data mining, text mining or other methods for unstructured data mining, will also be covered. Examples, assignments, and the final project will be designed to help students learn using machine learning techniques to complement traditional econometrics analysis.","title":"Machine Learning and Economic Forecasting","department":"Economics","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ECA5304","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
