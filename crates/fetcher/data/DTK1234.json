{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"In this module, students use design principles to develop their creative potential and practise design thinking using a people-centered approach to solve problems and create new possibilities. Through practical activities, students will discover tools and mindsets that guide them in navigating ambiguity in a creative process, observing and learning from others in unfamiliar contexts, and generating and experimenting with ideas quickly. While students draw on design thinking as a personal creative skillset, they will also value the impact of design that affords people the opportunity and privilege to shape the world that they, and others, inhabit.","title":"Design Thinking","department":"Industrial Design","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"DTK1234","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,2,0,5,2]}
