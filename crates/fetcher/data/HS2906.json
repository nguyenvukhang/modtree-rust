{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Why is the sea so important to us? Human engagements with the maritime world are introduced through three themes ‘Exploration, Extraction and Expression’. By integrating humanities and scientific approaches, this module examines the drivers of human pursuit for knowledge, resources, and inspiration from the vast oceans of the world. The consequences of these interactions are monumental, creating multiple fundamental shifts in collective knowledge yet also presenting challenges through unsustainable acquisition of ocean resources. These challenges are framed in historical, socio-economic and regional contexts to facilitate authentic discourse on emerging solutions that mitigate anthropogenic impacts to ocean ecosystems.","title":"Saltwater: Society and the Sea","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Priority for CHS students","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HS2906","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,0,6]}
