{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module aims to develop understanding of the fundamental principles underlying common experimental techniques, as well as the advantages and limitations of each technique for specific research applications. This in turn will facilitate the critical analysis of experimental data. Techniques covered will include different ways to study nucleic acids, proteins and lipids, key recent advances such as next-generation sequencing and CRISPR, disease-specific approaches such as in stem cell and cancer biology, and the importance of big data analysis in the fast-evolving biomedical research landscape.","title":"Techniques in Biomedical Research","department":"NUS Medicine Dean's Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MDG5102","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[]}
