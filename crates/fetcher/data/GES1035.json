{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GESS1025","description":"As   an   economically-developed   nation   with  a  diverse   population,    Singapore  now  confronts a range  of   socioeconomic  issues,   a  rapidly  ageing    population,   declining  fertility  rates,  widening  income  inequality,  and  rising  living  costs  amidst  increasing  global  competition,  technological    advancements,  and  security    threats.  Singaporeans  have  also  become  a  people  with  a  greater  propensity  to  participate  in  the  decisions  that  affect  the  nation. This module aims to encourage undergraduates to reflect   on   Singaporeâ€™s    post-independence    history,   imagine  the  kind  of  Singapore  they  would  like  to  co-create, and deliberate on the ways to achieve the future visions   they   have   for   Singapore.  All  lectures  will be mounted online.","title":"Singapore: Imagining the Next 50 Years","department":"Sociology and Anthropology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GES1035","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,1,0,3,5]}
