{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GET1031A Computational Thinking; GEI1001","description":"Through a series of fun and engaging hands-on activities, this module aims to equip students with the ability to thoughtfully apply computational tools when solving complex real-world problems. In particular, this module aims to impart students with the ability to critically self-evaluate the way they apply these tools, and thus be able to reason effectively in a variety of contexts. They will learn to identify problems and design solutions, while also developing a critical awareness of the merits and limits of their methods, thereby empowering them to make better-informed decisions and to articulate the reasons for those decisions.","title":"Computational Reasoning","department":"Philosophy","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GET1050","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,4,3]}
