Using urban design projects of different scales that deal with programming, planning and design, the studio encourages the integration of political, social, economic, environmental, and physical concerns in the design of urban spaces. The studio will also analyse successful urban design projects in the form of case studies. Urban Design Studio 2 will include a compulsory international workshop in the form of a field trip to a regional city to work with the relevant local planning/design authority and academic institution (cost of fieldtrip borne by student).","title":"Urban Studio Design 2","department":"Architecture","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"8","module_code":"UD5602","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,4,0,4,8]}
