{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"L4481V/LL5481V/LLJ5481V/LL6481V Trusts Law in the Asia-Pacific Region","description":"This subject explores the influence and potential of trusts law in the Asia-Pacific region. It begins by considering the history of trusts diffusion, how trusts law has been used to regulate customary and religious property-holding forms, and assesses the ways in which the trust has been (re)conceptualised in non-common law jurisdictions. It then examines the different uses of the trust in the region: in the family and commercial contexts, as well as a financial product. The subject also considers the reach of constructive and resulting trusts in the region. Finally, it will discuss trusts lawâ€™s private international law perspective.","title":"Trusts Law in the Asia-Pacific Region","department":"FoL Dean's Office","faculty":"Law","prerequisite":"NUS Compulsory Core Law Curriculum or common law equivalent","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LL5481","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,0,7]}
