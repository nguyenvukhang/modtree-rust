{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"DBA3711","description":"The module builds upon the foundation in ST2334 and stresses on applications of stochastic modeling. Topics include Review of basic probability and random variables; Conditional probability and conditional expectation; Discrete time Markov chains; Poisson process; Continuous time Markov chains; Basics in queuing theory and Basics renewal processes. Students will eventually be conversant with the properties of these models and appreciate their roles in engineering applications.","title":"Probability Models With Applications","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"ST2334 or EE2012 or CE2407 or BN2102","module_credit":"4","module_code":"IE2100","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["ST2334","EE2012","CE2407","BN2102"]},"fulfill_requirements":["IE3100R","IE3110","IE3120","IE4220","IE4239","IE4299","IE4243","IE3100M","IE3110R","IE4214"],"workload":[3,1,0,3,3]}
