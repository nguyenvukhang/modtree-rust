{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module is the second part to a two-part module introducing students to an Asia-centred transnational history and theory of architecture and urbanism. It is shaped around weekly themes to emphasize the ways that societies interacted with environments, resources, cultures and technologies to co-produce the built environment across different geographies. This module begins in approximately 1400 CE, on the verge of several seismic shifts in global history that profoundly influenced the planetary (built) environment. The module traces these shifts across six centuries to see how imperialism, industrialisation, modernisation, and globalisation connected the world unevenly, leading to the present climate crisis.","title":"History & Theory of Architecture II","department":"Architecture","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"AR2227 History & Theory of Architecture I","module_credit":"4","module_code":"AR2228","prereq_tree":"AR2227","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
