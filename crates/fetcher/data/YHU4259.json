{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The Zuo zhuan 左傳 (Zuo commentary) has long been considered the most influential work of both historiography and narrative prose in the entire Chinese tradition. A major source and model for Sima Qian’s Shi ji and the most anthologized work in such Qing-dynasty literary collections as Guwen guanzhi, it is also the single richest source for the study of pre-imperial Chinese history. This course will focus on a close reading of the work as an ideal case study for exploring the writing of history as a creative literary act and the fine boundary that pertains between history and fiction.","title":"Historiography of the Zuo Zhuan","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU4259","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
