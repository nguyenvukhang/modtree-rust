{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Biodesign was developed in Stanford University in 2001 as a process for innovating medical technologies. It provides a framework to appreciate essential considerations in medical device development, and also a platform for interdisciplinary communications. In this course, students will learn about the Biodesign process through guided exercises on assigned clinical needs. This includes topics from the phases of “Identify” (understanding the clinical need and context) and “Invent” (developing and evaluating solutions). Additionally, through interaction with peers and facilitators, students are expected to develop communication skills, particularly in interdisciplinary fields.","title":"The Biodesign Process of Innovation in Healthcare","department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Graduate students enrolled in Engineering and Business\nfaculties","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BN5501","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
