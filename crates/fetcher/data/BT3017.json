{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module covers topics that are important for preparation of data and features for machine learning. Real life raw data and features extracted from these data often have inherent problems that need to be fixed before feeding to machine learning systems. Such problems include missing data; redundant data; data that are not in numerical form; data that are of different scales and statistical distributions; outliers; unstructured data such as audio, picture, video, and text; huge dimensionality of features that need higher level of abstraction, etc. This module teaches students how to handle such problems that occur in the real world.","title":"Feature Engineering for Machine Learning","department":"Information Systems and Analytics","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"(CS1010 Programming Methodology or its equivalent) and [ST2334 Probability and Statistics or (ST2131 Probability and ST2132 Mathematical Statistics)] and (BT1101 Introduction to Business Analytics)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BT3017","prereq_tree":{"and":["CS1010",{"and":[],"or":["ST2334",{"and":["ST2131","ST2132"],"or":[]}]},"BT1101"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,0,7]}
