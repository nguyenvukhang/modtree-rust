{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module offers students theoretical and applied understandings of mobilities as a productive site of social life and culture. Drawing perspectives from the ‘new’ mobilities paradigm, it demonstrates how movement is not a sterile activity or zone, but a space replete with meaning. To exemplify this point, this course takes transportation as a lens of analysis, and interrogates its socio‐cultural organization and experience. Three aspects will be emphasized, namely the identities and embodiments latent in transportation; the infrastructures of transit; and the (geo)politics of mobility. Case studies will be drawn internationally, including Asia.","title":"Mobile Spaces: Making Social Worlds","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed at least 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track. \n\n(Global Studies students) Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE or 28MCs in GL/GL recognised non-language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed at least 80MCs, including 28MCs in GE, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"GE4226","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,7.0,5.5]}
