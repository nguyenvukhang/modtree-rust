{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The laws of thermodynamics mean we can convert solar energy into electricity, but not with 100% efficiency. While global warming causes the polar icecaps to undergo a phase change (melting), we develop materials that use phase changes to store energy efficiently, and to prevent lithium batteries from overheating. This module introduces the laws of thermodynamics and their application in materials science via case studies. It introduces, for example, the concept of entropy and its relationship to heat, and strategies for deriving thermodynamic relationships. We will also investigate the separation of oxygen from air, which appears to violate the second law.","title":"Principles of Renewable Energy","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MLE2102","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["MLE2103","MLE3101","MLE3102","MLE3103","MLE3104","MLE3202","MLE3203","MLE3101A","MLE3111A","MLE3112","MLE4221"],"workload":[3.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,6.0]}
