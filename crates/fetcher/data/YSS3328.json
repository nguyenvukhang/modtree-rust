{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course is designed to introduce students to thinking about gender in relation to urban life. Through a consideration of a wide variety of cities from all over the world, we will examine how gender is inscribed in city landscapes, how it is lived and embodied in relation to race, class, and sexuality, and how it is (re)produced through violence, inequality, and resistance. Key topics we will address include: concepts of public/private spheres; politics of respectability; sexual violence and public spaces; pleasure and sex in the city; gender and transport; and feminist urban planning.","title":"Gender in the City","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS3328","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,5.5,4.0]}
