They will be equipped with skills to analyse aspects of truth and realism that straddle documentary image-making and society, each developing and completing a documentary project during the course. There will be hands-on production, screenings, discussions and readings into the function and aesthetics of the documentary. Through these, students will learn a range of methodologies. In addition, the course will examine ways through which the documentary can inform, comment on and shape social and political concerns in everyday life.","title":"The Document in Image-Making","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3377","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,5.0,4.5]}
