{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces the different contemporary and emerging technologies and techniques that have become essential components of urban greening design and practices. It traces the origins of such technologies and techniques as responses to challenges in creating a green and ecologically-balanced urban environment, explains their scientific underpinnings, and provides examples of real-life applications. Topics covered include metrics used to measure greenery, technologies used to integrate greenery with the grey (buildings and infrastructure), blue (waterways and waterbodies) and brown (road infrastructure) elements of the built environment and plants as the basic building blocks of functional landscapes.","title":"Urban Greening: Technologies and Techniques","department":"Architecture","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LAD4012","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,2,4]}
