{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"By 2050, half of the world’s population will live in cities, placing additional demand on core infrastructure such as food, water, transportation, and healthcare. Throughout the course, we will explore the concept of urban sustainability in general with emphasis on intersectional climate change challenges here in Singapore. But is sustainability enough in our changing world? And what are some ways we can redesign our cities in ways that make efficient use of the resources we have? We’ll look at potential solutions such as the circular economy, industrial symbiosis, and work with Mandai Parks to analyse their own resource flows.","title":"Rethinking Sustainability in a Green City","department":"NUS College","faculty":"NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NST2047","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,0,0,3,3]}
