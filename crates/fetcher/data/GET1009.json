The course will introduce students to Gandhi’s writings and ideas on several issues, including non-violence, colonialism, modernity, ethics, science and health. The aim would be to not only expose students to the complexity of Gandhi — the man and his ideas — but to critically interrogate Gandhi and his legacies.","title":"Maverick or Mahatma?
