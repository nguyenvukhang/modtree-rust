The main reason for studying computational learning is to make better use of powerful computers to learn knowledge (or regularities) from the raw data. The ultimate objective is to build self-learning systems to relieve human from some of already-too-many programming tasks. At the end of the course, students are expected to be familiar with the theories and paradigms of computational learning, and capable of implementing basic learning systems.","title":"Machine Learning","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"(CS2010 or CS2020 or CS2040 or its equivalent) and \n(MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1508E or MA1513) and \n(MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1507 or (MA1511 and MA1512) or MA1521) and \n(EE2012/A or MA2216 or ST2131 or ST2334)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS3244","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["CS2010","CS2020","CS2040"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1101R","MA1311","MA1508E","MA1513"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1102R","MA1505","MA1507",{"and":["MA1511","MA1512"],"or":[]},"MA1521"]},{"and":[],"or":["EE2012","EE2012A","MA2216","ST2131","ST2334"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS5242","CS6283","CS6284","CS5339","CS6216","IS4152","IS5452","DSA4261","DSA4262","DSA4263","DSA4264","DSA4265","DSA4266","DSA4261A","DSA4262A","DSA4263A","DSA4264A","DSA4265A","DSA4266A","DSA4261B","DSA4262B","DSA4263B","DSA4264B","DSA4265B","DSA4266B"],"workload":[2,1,4,0,3]}
