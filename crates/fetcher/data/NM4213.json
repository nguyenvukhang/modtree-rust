{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"NM3206","description":"Our economy is increasingly influenced by digital elements — ranging from platforms to cryptocurrencies, financial derivatives to smart cities. This course approaches the analysis of digital economies from the multidisciplinary perspectives of economics, communication, political economy, cultural studies, and critical theory. We will review the geographically and historically uneven ways that digital economies are developed, and examine the impact they have on populations, urban cities, and natural ecologies. Focused especially on contemporary trends, the module will also reveal opportunities for experimenting and rethinking what digital economies can do to promote fairer societies, and better lives.","title":"Digital Economies","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2011 and before: (Not applicable to SOC students) Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.50 or be on the Honours track. \n\n(For SOC students) Completed 80 MCs and obtain a minimum CAP of 3.50. \n\nCohort 2012-2019: (Not applicable to SOC students) Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM or 28 MCs in GL/GL recognised non‐language modules, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track. \n\n(For SOC students) Completed 80 MCs and obtain a minimum CAP of 3.20.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: (Not applicable to SOC students) Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in NM, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours t7rack. \n\n(For SOC students) Completed 80 MCs and obtain a minimum CAP of 3.20.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"NM4213","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,5.0,7.5]}
