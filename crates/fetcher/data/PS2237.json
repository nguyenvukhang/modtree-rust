{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Designed as an introductory theoretical module, it covers the basic concepts of International Relations in two halves. The first introduces the concepts of nation, state, sovereignty, non-state actors and their implications for the coexistence of nation-states, as well as a brief roundup of the instruments of conducting relations among them. The other offers a grounding in the major schools of thought on International Relations, namely realism, liberalism/pluralism and revolutionism. Additionally, there will be topics on radical perspectives such as feminism, constructivism and postmodernism. It is hoped the module will provide students with a foundation for other courses in the sub-field.","title":"Introduction to International Relations","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PS2237","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["PS3880F"],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
