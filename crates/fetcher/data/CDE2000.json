{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Creating Narratives is an interdisciplinary module which aims to explore the principles of communication in Design and Engineering. The purpose of the course is to make explicit to students how they can draw on visual and verbal resources to clearly articulate the valued knowledge in their disciplines to both specialist and non-specialist audiences in a succinct manner. Students will explore a range of narratives around multimodal artefacts such as posters, renderings, drawings, models and exhibits from these disciplines to become familiar with the ways to engage, inform, critique and persuade different audiences and communicate their designs effectively.","title":"Creating Narratives","department":"Industrial Design","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"ES1000\nES1103\n\nPlease note that these prerequisites only apply to those who are referred to them following a qualifying English test, not to the general student population and as such this module will be S/U-able, following the item in BUS Circular 4 of AY2014/15 regarding S/U eligibility.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CDE2000","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1,2,0,4,3]}
