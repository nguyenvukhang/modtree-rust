{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Southeast Asian images, objects and events lead us to rethink art-historical methods and dominant modern ideas about what is art. We will study particular kinds of objects, architecture, institutions, performances and events with attention to how they exist(ed) and function(ed) in their world, to continuities and change, and to the methodological issues involved. This will involve a critical reading of selected studies of Southeast Asian arts and reflection on artistic phenomena in their world. Topics include: art-historical preconceptions about art; temples and landscape; palaces and museums; collecting; textiles; masks and puppets; music and theatre; and modern and contemporary art.","title":"Arts in Southeast Asia","department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SEA5212","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,1,6]}
