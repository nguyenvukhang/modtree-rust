{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This is an introductory course on the fundamental constituents of matter and their basic interactions; important concepts and principles, recent important experiments, underlying theoretical tools and calculation techniques in elementary particles physics will be expounded. The topics covered are: basic properties of elementary particles and the standard model, relativistic kinematics; symmetries: isospin and SU(3), quark model;  parity and CP violation; Feynman diagrams and rules; quantum electrodynamics; cross sections and lifetimes: deep inelastic scattering; and introductory gauge theories and unified models. This module is mainly targeted at physics majors.","title":"Particle Physics","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students who have passed PC3130 and PC3232","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC4245","prereq_tree":{"and":["PC3130","PC3232"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
