{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module is designed to cover foundational anthropological and ethnographic methods. These processes include fieldwork, documentation, and the presentation and production of the eventual text that typically carry description, representation and interpretive analysis. How is anthropological fieldwork conducted in the study of different cultures? How do anthropologists detail social relations and human behaviour in the field? What are the methods and modes of evidence which anthropologists deploy in the presentation of their arguments and data? Students will therefore be imparted with key methodological skills and techniques of how anthropologists practice their craft when carrying out research.","title":"Research Methods in Anthropology","department":"Sociology and Anthropology","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"AN2101","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
