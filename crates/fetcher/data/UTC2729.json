{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Causal questions ranging from “does vitamin C cure colds” to “does immigration hurt local low-wage workers” are crucial to everyday decision-making and societal challenges. Causal inferences are drawn from randomized experiments, where researchers allocate individuals to treatment groups by a random draw. In social and human systems, natural experiments – situations arising in real life that resemble randomised experiments – offer a powerful way to study causal links. With a focus on intuition and practical understanding, this module discusses the motivation, identification, and interpretation of natural experiments, which are fruits of system-wide knowledge and interdisciplinary endeavors.","title":"Causality and Natural Experiments","department":"Residential College 4","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTC2729","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,4,3]}
