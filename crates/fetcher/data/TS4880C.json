{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Live performance is a vibrant and dynamic art form, and innovations in aesthetics and technique mean that it is constantly changing. Over the course of this module, students will conduct a critical assessment of recent developments in performance practice, and of their implications for performance theory and analysis. Recent trends in performance and scholarship will be surveyed, informed by a combination of publications, electronic resources, and theatre‐going. Students will be assessed on their capacity to develop informed responses to the work, to conduct and present independent research into current trends, and to reflect critically on the concept of the ‘contemporary’.","title":"Contemporary Performance Practices","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in TS, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"TS4880C","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,6.0,6.5]}
