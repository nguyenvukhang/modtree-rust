{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course focuses on how states formulate and implement their foreign policies. It is structured based on different levels of analysis: systems, state, leaders, bureaucracies/institutions, and society. The course analyses the various constraints that each of these actors face, how they interact with each other, and the processes and mechanisms through which they resolve their differences and formulate policy. It also examines the conditions in the implementation process that impact policy outcomes. Major themes include the state as rational actor, the role of personalities and their psychology, the impact of ideas and cultures, bureaucratic politics, and the role of interest groups and coalitions.","title":"Foreign Policy Analysis","department":"LKYSPP Dean's Office","faculty":"LKY School of Public Policy","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PP5905","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
