{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EE5913, EE5132, EE5023, EE5024, CS4222","description":"This module teaches the key concepts in wireless and sensor networks for the Internet of Things (IoT). The first part is on wireless networks and covers the wireless channel, modulation schemes, medium access control, routing protocols, ad hoc wireless networks and wireless mesh networks. The second part is on IoT sensor networks which enable visibility into physical processes and digitalisation. This part starts with IoT wireless and application protocols, and IoT architectures incorporating edge computing. Subsequently, topics on energy management, data fusion and tracking are covered. The module concludes with advanced topics such as vehicular sensor networks and activity recognition.","title":"Wireless and Sensor Networks for IoT","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Requires background knowledge such as EE4204 Computer Networks or EE4210 Network Protocols and Applications, or equivalent.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CEG5103","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["EE4204","EE4210"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
