{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"UTW1001% and UTW2001% series","description":"In this module, students will examine how various literary texts are adapted into films. They will do so by interrogating how directorial techniques, institutional constraints and related socio-cultural contexts inform adaptations. Specifically, students will watch and analyse cinematic adaptations of plays, short stories, and comics to bring to the surface how aesthetic elements ranging from mise-en-scene to socio-cultural factors influence filmmakers and studiosâ€™ motivations. In the process, students will develop a systematic approach in carrying out a critique of adapted films they enjoy.","title":"Print to Screen: Analysing Film Adaptation","department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic Purposes modules.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"RVX1003","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,4,0,0,6]}
