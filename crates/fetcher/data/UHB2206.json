A student-selected USPitch Project provides a first-hand practical experience of the issues explored in earlier sections.","title":"Leadership in a Complex World","department":"University Scholars Programme","faculty":"University Scholars Programme","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UHB2206","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,4,0,6]}
