{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Food and ecology are inextricably linked through the production of domesticated food through agriculture and livestock and in the harvesting of wild plants and animals.  The production and consumption of food has downstream consequences through energy consumption, food waste, trophic interactions and transportation of food worldwide.  These topics link to many of the fundamental concepts of ecology, including population biology, the niche, trophic interactions, nitrogen cycling and the effects on biodiversity.  This module explores each of these topics intensely through lectures, guest lectures, readings and interactive field trips to local systems.","title":"The Ecology of Food","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YID2215","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,2.0,0.0,3.0,7.5]}
