What are the dynamics at play between local audiences and global media products? How do media technologies alter relations between producers and consumers of popular cultural products? This module reflects on the open nature of media audiences and how they have been conceptualised by global media producers of TV, music and film. It explores how message makers or producers (artists, broadcasters, filmmakers, advertisers) try, and sometimes fail, to shape and adapt their messages for different social and cultural contexts.","title":"The Global Audience","department":"Communications and New Media","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NMC5367","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,4,3]}
