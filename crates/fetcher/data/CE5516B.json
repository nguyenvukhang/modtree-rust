The primary objective of this module is to equip participants with fundamental understanding and technical knowledge needed for the dynamic analysis and design of buildings. The philosophy and concepts taught are applicable to onshore and offshore structures subjected to loadings resulting from sources such as earthquake, wind, waves and blast. Students will have to complete the dynamic analysis of a multi-dimensional structure using a software used in engineering practice.\n\nThe module is targeted at post-graduate and senior under-graduate civil engineering students with a keen interest on dynamic analysis and design.","title":"Structural Dynamics Concepts & Applications","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Background in structural matrix analysis","module_credit":"2","module_code":"CE5516B","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
