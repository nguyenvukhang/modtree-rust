{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"BN1102","description":"This module is the second of a set of two modules: Engineering Principle and Practice I and II (EPP I and EPP II). EPP modules aim to introduce first year students to the biomedical engineerâ€™s way of thinking and addressing problems. A real-life medical technology will be used to demonstrate the fundamental knowledge and skills that a biomedical engineer is expected to possess. In EPP II, students will be exposed to key engineering problems such as how systems are controlled, powered and optimized.","title":"Biomedical Engineering Principles and Practice II","department":"Biomedical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BN2111","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,2,0,0,5]}
