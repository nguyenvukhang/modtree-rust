{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"DSC3221","description":"This course introduces students to the basic concepts of discrete-event simulation systems and application to problems that have no closed-form solutions. The course will cover modeling techniques, random number generators, discrete-event simulation approaches, simulated data analysis, simulation variance reduction techniques and state-of-the-art simulation software. At the end of this course, students will be able to analyze and develop simulation models of given problems.","title":"Simulation","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"IE2100 or DSC3215","module_credit":"4","module_code":"IE3110R","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["IE2100","DSC3215"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3.0,0.5,0.5,3.0,3.0]}
