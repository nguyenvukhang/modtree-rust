{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MA2213","description":"This module aims at introducing basic concepts and wellestablished\nnumerical methods that are very related to the\ncomputing foundation of data science and analytics. The\nemphasis is on the tight integration of numerical\nalgorithms, implementation in industrial programming\nlanguage, and examination on practical examples drawn\nfrom various disciplines related to data science. Major\ntopics include: computer arithmetic, matrix multiplication,\nnumerical methods for solving linear systems, least\nsquares method, interpolation, concrete implementations\nin industrial program language, and sample applications\nrelated to data science.","title":"Essential Data Analytics Tools: Numerical Computation","department":"Mathematics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(MA1101R or MA1508E or MA1513 or MA2001) and (MA1102R or MA1312 or MA1505 or MA1511 or MA1521 or MA2002)","module_credit":"4","module_code":"DSA2102","prereq_tree":{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["MA1101R","MA1508E","MA1513","MA2001"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1102R","MA1312","MA1505","MA1511","MA1521","MA2002"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["MA3227","MA4230","MA4255","MA4268","MA4270","DSE4211","QF4211","DSE4212","QF4212"],"workload":[3,1,0,2,4]}
