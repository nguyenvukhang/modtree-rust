{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Students will learn advanced topics related to vibroacoustics systems. A special topic for vibroacoustics will be chosed for each semester, such as sonic crystals, inerter systems, acoustic metamaterials, energy harvesting, shock and vibration mitigation. Practical examples and case studies will be discussed. Students will work on a mini project for half of the semester, demonstrating the ability to do literature review, design and analysis of the system, prototyping, modelling and experimentation. The module is100% continuous assessment based on a mini project. This module is for graduate students interested in learning about research techniques and state-of-the-art topics in vibration and acoustics.","title":"Advances in Vibroacoustics","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME6108","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,1,6]}
