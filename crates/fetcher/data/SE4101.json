Students are introduced to various ideas about 'theory' and 'practice' in research on Southeast Asia. Different disciplinary approaches are compared and evaluated in terms of the way they formulate research questions, conceptualise research design and measure evidence. Attention will also be paid to modes of writing and representation adopted in texts under study. Seminar discussions are aimed at helping students think critically about the suitability of various approaches to their own research interests.","title":"Southeast Asia Studies: Theory and Practice","department":"Southeast Asian Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2019 and before: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in SE, or 28MCs in GL or GL recognised non-language modules with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nCohort 2020 onwards: Completed 80MCs, including 28MCs in SE with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"SE4101","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,7.5]}
