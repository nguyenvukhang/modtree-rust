{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"PC2412, PC2132","description":"This essential module for Physics majors gives a first look at and serves as a model for the mathematical treatment of all later Theoretical Physics modules. It assumes knowledge from H2 Mathematics (or equivalent) and is intended for students who wish to acquire a deep understanding of our Mechanical Universe. It considers the principles of Newtonian Mechanics and covers topics such as kinematics, inertial and non-inertial reference frames, linear momentum, kinetic energy, and angular momentum; Newton's laws of motion, forces and torques; systems of many particles including rigid bodies; conservation laws; Newtonian gravity and Keplerâ€™s laws of planetary motion.","title":"Classical Mechanics I","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"(PC1101 or PC1431) and H2 Mathematics/Further Mathematics or equivalent.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC2032","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["PC1101","PC1431"]},"fulfill_requirements":["PC3246","PC3288","PC3261","PC3411","PC3413","PC3288A"],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
