This module introduces students to key concepts and frameworks of political ecology, which is a broad field of study and research that focuses on socio-environmental conflicts and their origins. Through a variety of teaching and learning modes, students examine landscape case studies representing different contexts, scales, and histories to uncover diverse human‚Äêenvironment interactions. There is an emphasis on applying different tools and methods to conduct and communicate political ecology research.","title":"Political Eco and Land","department":"Architecture","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LAD4007","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
