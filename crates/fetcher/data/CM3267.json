{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces the elements of computational thinking and its application in chemistry, energy and the environment and food science. These elements include problem formulation/abstraction, pattern recognition, decomposition, and finally algorithm design. Direct application of these elements will occur through programming specifically using Python on a Raspberry Pi computer. The Raspberry Pi will be programmed to make real-time observations of phenomena relevant to the environment and/or food science.","title":"Computational Thinking and Programming in Chemistry","department":"Chemistry","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Either (a) OR (b) below:\n(a) CM2191 Experiments in Chemistry 2 AND\nCM2192 Experiments in Chemistry 3\nOR\n(b) FST2102B Chemistry of Food Components","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CM3267","prereq_tree":{"and":["CM2191",{"and":[],"or":["CM2192","FST2102B"]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,3,2,3]}
