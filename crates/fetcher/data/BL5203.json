{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Molecular recognition forms the basis of the regulation of cell-biological responses to extracellular and intracellular stimuli. This module focuses on recent progress in our understanding of how macromolecular machines are organized and interact with one another inside of cells. To illustrate the intricate details and consequences of molecular interactions, the module will use the cell nucleus as the organizing theme, but the principles are applicable to all aspects of cell biology. Students with background in biology and chemistry and protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions are recommended to read this module.","title":"Molecular Recognition and Interactions","department":"Biological Sciences","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Students should have read Biology and Chemistry at undergraduate level","module_credit":"4","module_code":"BL5203","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,4,2]}
