{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"It is estimated that in any given society 3‐10% of the population has some form of disability. This increases to 15% when the definition of disability includes people who are limited in activity due to chronic conditions. In Singapore a conservative estimate of persons with some form of disability may be anywhere from 120,000 to 400,000 individuals. This would include both a medical perspective as well as a socio‐functional perspective which emphasizes the need to address economic, environmental and cultural barriers. This module will use a life span perspective to discuss the impact of disability on the individual.","title":"Practice with Persons with Disability","department":"Social Work","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"SWM5213","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
