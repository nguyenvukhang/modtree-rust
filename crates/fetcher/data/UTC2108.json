Through a socio-historical treatment of figures associated with knowledge, students will discuss how experts are created, challenged, and replaced. This module will enable students to critically appreciate various forms of knowledge, analyse and respond to current issues related to expertise, understand the context in which our methods and processes for acquiring knowledge are situated, and assess how they shape individual and collective lives and experiences.","title":"Knowledge and Expertise","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"GEM1902% or GEM1912% or UTC11%","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTC2108","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["GEM1902","GEM1912"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
