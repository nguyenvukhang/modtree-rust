{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EU4220","description":"This module, whose specific content may change from time to time within the following guidelines, presents an interdisciplinary approach, but one grounded in the literary, to a topic in European literature, especially but not exclusively from the Romantic, Modernist or Contemporary periods. Always comparative (across two nations at least), it considers aspects of a period, a movement, a thematic issue or a combination of all these. Texts are chosen not only for their intrinsic merits but for their complementarity to the English Literature curriculum in general, and, as a module crosslisted with European Studies, to that programme also.","title":"Topics in European Literature","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Completed 80 MCs including 28 MCs in EN, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track","module_credit":"5","module_code":"EN4263","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,2.0,7.5]}
