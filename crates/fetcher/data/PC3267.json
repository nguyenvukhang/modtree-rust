{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module aims to introduce the principles and approaches of physics in the area of molecular biophysics. It includes molecular complexes of biomolecules; physical and symmetrical relationships between biomolecules; physical and structural characteristics of proteins and amino acids; symmetric and statistical descriptions of nucleic acids; first law and second law of thermodynamics in biological systems; bonding and non-bonding potentials, and stabilizing interactions in biomacromolecules, and the correlation to macromolecular structures; molecular mechanics in biological systems; bio soft condensed materials, bio-membrane and biomembrane structure, principles of molecular self assembly of biomolecules. There is a lab component included in this module. This module is targeted at both physics and non-physics students who already have basic knowledge in physics and life sciences.","title":"Biophysics II","department":"Physics","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PC2020 or PC2031 or PC2131 or PC2267 or EE2011 or Departmental Approval","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PC3267","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["PC2020","PC2031","PC2131","PC2267","EE2011"]},"fulfill_requirements":["PC4267","PC4268"],"workload":[2,1,1,2,4]}
