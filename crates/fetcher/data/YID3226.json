{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The module grapples with the socio-ecological tensions of the global spread of capitalist social relations since the nineteenth century, focusing on the post-World War II era of “development” as one involving both prospects and pitfalls for actors at various scales (e.g., individuals, nation-states, regions). A central focus is on the ambivalent ramifications of the global commodification of nature during this period. Topics include, among others, “development” under hyper-urbanisation, natural resource “paradoxes,” the global “meatification” of diets, the state’s unique “optics” vis-a-vis the socio-natural world, and tensions inherent to the modern health industry.","title":"Capitalist Nature: Tensions of a Commodified World","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YID3226","prereq_tree":"YCC2121","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
