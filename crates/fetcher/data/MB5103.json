{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module, required for doctoral students in Mechanobiology, studies the scientific seminar as a mode of communication, as well as studying a variety of\nmechanobiology topics that will be presented in seminar format. Students will have opportunities to work on 1) extracting information from research seminars;\n2) critical listening; 3) constructive criticism and identifying areas for\nimprovement; and 4) presenting a brief seminar on material directly related to\ntheir own research. Seminars will be presented by visiting scientists, members\nof the RCE, and the students themselves. Seminars are an effective way for students to interact with the broader scientific community and to keep abreast of the most recent research. The ultimate goal for this module is to\nenable students to get the greatest benefit from research seminars, whether they are participating as audience members or as speakers.","title":"Research Seminars in Mechanobiology","department":"Mechanobiology Institute (MBI)","faculty":"Mechanobiology Institute (MBI)","prerequisite":"Designed for 2nd year doctoral students","module_credit":"2","module_code":"MB5103","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[1.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.5]}
