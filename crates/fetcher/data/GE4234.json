{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GE3223","description":"The tropics are presently the world's most rapidly changing region. This module looks in detail at the causes and consequences of high rates of environmental change in tropical environments. Environmental change will be looked at from two different perspectives; 1) Climate change (including sea-level changes and ocean acidification) and 2) anthropogenic change (including deforestation, agriculture and urbanization). Particular focus will be given to processes, linkages and interactions between climate and anthropogenic changes. Current high rates of changes in these processes, and their nature, are placed within a contemporary context with a particular focus on Asia.","title":"Environmental Change in the Tropics","department":"Geography","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"GE Majors: Completed 80 MCs, including 28 MCs in Major, with a minimum CAP of 3.20 or be on the Honours track.\n\nBES students: Completed 80 MCs of NUS modules before they can read any level-4000 GE modules.
