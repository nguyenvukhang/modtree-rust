{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces students to social and cultural historical studies on Middle-Period China from the 10th to 14th centuries, a period of profound political and social changes under the Song, Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties when China experienced alternating Chinese and foreign rules. Focusing on major scholarly debates and cutting-edge studies in recent decades, the seminar equips students the craft of historians through identifying and discussing the “golden triangle” of questions, sources, and methods. It enables students to rethink their conventional knowledge about Middle-Period Chinese history and to critically review the most significant or latest Chinese and English scholarship.","title":"Sociocultural History of Middle Period China","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CHC5345","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,5,5]}
