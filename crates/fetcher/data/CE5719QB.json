{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CE5719B","description":"This module aims to introduce the fundamentals and engineering practices for the construction and monitoring of fixed ocean infrastructure to harvest the offshore wind energy. This module extends the design principles in CE5719QA to cover the installation of the support structures for offshore wind turbine and monitoring of the structural damage caused by the environmental actions on such structures. The module will allow students to understand the basic principles in assessing the performance of the support structures under cyclic environmental and operational actions, as well as engineering approaches for corrosion protection for these structures operating offshore.","title":"Integrity of Fixed Wind Turbine Structures","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Background in structural mechanics","module_credit":"2","module_code":"CE5719QB","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,2,0]}
