{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CS1010 or its equivalents","description":"This module introduces the concepts of programming and computational problem solving, and is the first and foremost introductory module to computing. Starting from a small core of fundamental abstractions, the module introduces programming as a method for communicating computational processes. The module begins with purely functional programming based on a simple substitution-based execution model, and ends with a powerful modern imperative language based on a realistic environment-based execution model. Topics covered include functional abstraction, recursion, higher-order functions, data abstraction, algorithmic strategies, state mutation, loops and arrays, evaluation strategies, sorting and searching, debugging and testing.","title":"Programming Methodology","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS1101S","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["FIN4124","FIN4719","MA3269","QF2103"],"workload":[2,2,1,0,2]}
