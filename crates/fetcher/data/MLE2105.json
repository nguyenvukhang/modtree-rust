{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Did you know your smartphone contains at least 75 different elements from the periodic table? These elements are combined in a variety of different ways to produce materials with a full spectrum of electronic properties from electric conductors to insulators; from optically transparent to light admitting materials; and that’s just the start. Tomorrow’s devices will utilise unique material properties as their dimensions approach the nano- or atomic scale. Students will be introduced to the materials that enable electronic devices, via basic quantum mechanics, conduction, energy, potential, doping, and related theories, focussing on examples of current devices and applications.","title":"Electronic Properties of Materials","department":"Materials Science and Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MLE2105","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["MLE3105","MLE4101","MLE4206","MLE4208","MLE4101R","MLE4207","MLE4210","MLE4220"],"workload":[3.0,0.5,0.0,0.5,6.0]}
