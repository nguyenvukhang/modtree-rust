{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course deals with the theory of functions of a complex variable. The topics to be covered are the Cauchy-Riemann equations and power series, the properties of analytic and entire functions, such as the maximum-modulus principle and the open mapping theorem, line and contour integrals and the residue theorem. If time permits, applications to boundary value problems for partial differential equations will also be treated.","title":"Complex Analysis","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC3206 Introduction to Real Analysis or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC4210","prereq_tree":"YSC3206","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,4.0,0.0,0.0,8.5]}
