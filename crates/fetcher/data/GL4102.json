Each Task Force seminar deals with a given policy problem from the real world. Students research the problem, investigate and debate solutions, and work together to produce a report that recommends policy solutions. Seminar participants apply the training they have received from the GL curriculum to the project. At the end of the semester, students present their report for evaluation. Potential Task Force problems include energy security, terrorism, human trafficking, and an aging population.","title":"Task Force","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"Cohort 2018 and before: GL majors ONLY.
