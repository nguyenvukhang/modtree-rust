{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The course provides an in-depth critical overview of the political science literature on vote choice in democratic elections, covering both some of the classics and some cutting-edge contributions. The frames of economic voting and of class politics are explored in detail, and their insights squared with perspectives that stress the importance of social identities like ethnicity and gender. We discuss also the general implications for democratic theory and for the prospects of democracy in the older democracies of north America, western Europe, and Asia-Pacific, and in younger democracies and emerging countries.","title":"Economic Interest, Identities, and Voting Behavior","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"PS4308","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,7.5,5.0]}
