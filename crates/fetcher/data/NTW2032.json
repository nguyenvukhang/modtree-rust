This course will teach students how to read, think, and write critically through discussions in philosophy, medicine, and technology. We will explore what it is to be a person and what it takes to be the same person over time. Our views about our identity will shape our attitudes towards our health and intuitions about puzzles of personal identity that arise in medical practice. Our attitudes towards personal identity and health go on to determine how far we will go in the pursuit of longevity.","title":"The Self in Health and Longevity","department":"NUS College Dean's Office","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"NTW2032","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,0,0,3,3]}
