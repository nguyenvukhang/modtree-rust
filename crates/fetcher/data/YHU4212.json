{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course examines changing discourses on evil from the eighteenth century to the aftermath of World War II; it explores shifts and developments in literary portrayals of the devil, varieties of theodicy, theories about the nature of human destructiveness, criminality, and the psychology of perpetrators of evil. Through a close reading of major works in philosophy and literature, we will pay particular attention to how understandings of evil have changed over time in response to both large scale socio-cultural transformations and traumatic historical events, such as the Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 and the Holocaust.","title":"The Problem of Evil from the Enlightenment to Auschwitz","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"All Year 1 and 2 Common Curriculum modules or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU4212","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
