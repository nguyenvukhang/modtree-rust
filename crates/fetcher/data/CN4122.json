{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical processes.","title":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"CN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN3124: Particle Technology\nCN3132: Separation Processes\nor\nCN2116: Chemical Kinetics and Reactor Design\nCN2121: Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics\nCN2122/CN2122A: Fluid Mechanics\nCN3132: Separation Processes","module_credit":"3","module_code":"CN4122","prereq_tree":{"and":["CN2116","CN2121"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":["CN4123R","CN4123"],"workload":[2.0,2.0,0.0,1.5,2.0]}
