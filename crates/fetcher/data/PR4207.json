Yet, it is also the most common agent to cause severe liver toxicity and emergency admissions to hospitals. So, is paracetamol a drug or a poison? Students will learn the fundamental toxicokinetic (TK)/toxicodynamic (TD) considerations to discuss when a drug is a drug or poison. The module also dives into the current and emerging trends in ADME and toxicity testing in drug discovery. Special PK topics such as nonlinearity and PK of protein drugs will be covered.","title":"Applied Pharmacokinetics and Toxicokinetics","department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PR3106 Pharmacokinetics and Drug Disposition\nor PR3116 Concepts in Pharmacokinetics and Biopharmaceutics\nor PHS3116 Pharmacokinetics and Biopharmaceutics or by special permission","module_credit":"4","module_code":"PR4207","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["PR3106","PR3116","PHS3116"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,2,0,2,3]}
