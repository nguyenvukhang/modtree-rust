{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Decision trees are supervised learning methods widely used for classification and regression. They are popular with practitioners because of the interpretability of the tree structures, reasonably good prediction accuracy, fast computational speed, and wide availability of software. In this course, participants will learn how to build and implement decision tree models, and assess their performance. The versatility of decision trees is demonstrated through practical applications. Participants will also learn how to improve prediction accuracy using bagging, random forests and boosting.","title":"Learning from Data: Decision Trees","department":"Statistics and Data Science","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"Passed DSA5831 Learning from Data: Principles and Practice","module_credit":"1","module_code":"DSA5841","prereq_tree":"DSA5831","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[5,4,0,6,5]}
