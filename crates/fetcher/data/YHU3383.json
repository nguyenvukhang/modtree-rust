{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module explores the meaning of artistic practices and conceptual methodologies in the face of the climate crisis. How can we process and discuss the challenges of the Anthropocene â€“ global warming, catastrophic climate change, mass extinction, pollution, sea-level rise, demographic conflicts etc. with artistic means of expression? What esthetic tools need to be studied, developed, invented today? The module offers perspectives on varied approaches to developing artistic agency. It encourages students to use creative media, analytic methodologies, and collaborative structures to become active, while demonstrating manifold forms of practice- and research methods and reaching out to other disciplines, like environmental studies.","title":"Art and Climate Artistic Practice in the Anthropocene","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3383","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,3.0,3.0,6.5]}
