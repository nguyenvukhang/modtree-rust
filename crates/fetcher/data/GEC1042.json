{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module introduces a revisionist fashion history that decenters the West (Europe and North America) and places the East as its equal counterpart. Sartorial cultures in Asia are studied in their own right and on their own terms. Students will explore the history of global cultural exchange through the lens of fashion, understand the differences and similarities between Eastern and Western sartorial cultures, and gain critical insights into contemporary fashion consumption and industry. The module follows a chronological and thematic approach that examines fashionâ€™s intersection with other domains of social life such as class, identity, and politics.","title":"Fashion: East and West","department":"Chinese Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GEC1042","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
