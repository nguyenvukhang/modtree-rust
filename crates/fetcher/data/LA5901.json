{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"The practice of landscape architecture requires a working knowledge of ecology. The ecological understanding of practitioners is particularly challenging in the tropics, which feature some of the worldâ€™s most diverse and complex ecosystems. This module aims to equip students with the foundational knowledge (ecological principles; vegetation types; habitats) and basic skills (plant identification, literature reviews) to recognise habitat types, interpret ecological properties of a site, and to be able to design and critique landscapes from an ecological perspective. The module is conducted through lectures and field trips.","title":"Special Topics in Landscape Architecture","department":"Architecture","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"LA5901","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,4,4]}
