{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Conflicting messages, inflated claims and quackery on the effects of foods/ diets often confuse our food choices. How do we separate food science facts from science fiction? We will deconstruct food at the physical, chemical and biological level and use this knowledge to examine and explain controversies that often surround food and its relationship with us. Students will be able to make informed decisions on food choices at the individual level, at the population level and appreciate what food needs to be for the future.","title":"Deconstructing Food","department":"Food Science and Technology","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"HSI1000 or SP2274 or equivalent, or module(s) approved by host faculty","module_credit":"4","module_code":"HSI2007","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["HSI1000","SP2274"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,3,4]}
