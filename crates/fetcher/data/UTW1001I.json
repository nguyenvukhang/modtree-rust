Such narratives can affect public attitudes and behaviour, often with far-reaching social and economic consequences. This course aims to evaluate some of these narratives to enable students to determine the degree to which they represent scientific 'truth'. By the end of the module, students should be in a better position to engage with media representations of science in general.","title":"Science and popular narratives","department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"Students must have passed/been exempted from the NUS Qualifying English Test (QET) or have passed CELC English for Academic Purposes modules.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTW1001I","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,4,0,0,6]}
