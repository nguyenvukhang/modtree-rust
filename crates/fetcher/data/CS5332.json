{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Biometrics (such as fingerprint, iris images) are commonly used for authentication. This module covers authentication methods, different types of biometrics, pattern recognition, performance measurement, spoofing attacks, as well as issues such as privacy, user acceptance, and standards compliance. Students will gain a solid understanding of the fundamentals of the technology underlying biometric authentication, and the key issues to be addressed for successful deployment. Both the theoretical and practical aspects of biometrics authentication will be discussed.","title":"Biometric Authentication","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"(CS2040 or its equivalent) and (MA1101R or MA1311 or MA1508E or MA1513) and \n(MA1102R or MA1505 or MA1507 or (MA1511 and MA1512) or MA1521) and \n(EE2012/A or ST2132 or ST2334 or ((MA2216 or ST2131) and (ST1131/A or ST1232 or DSC2008)))","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS5332","prereq_tree":{"and":["CS2040",{"and":[],"or":["MA1101R","MA1311","MA1508E","MA1513"]},{"and":[],"or":["MA1102R","MA1505","MA1507",{"and":["MA1511","MA1512"],"or":[]},"MA1521"]},{"and":[],"or":["EE2012","EE2012A","ST2132","ST2334",{"and":[{"and":[],"or":["MA2216","ST2131"]},{"and":[],"or":["ST1131","ST1131A","ST1232","DSC2008"]}],"or":[]}]}],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,2,6]}
