{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"EE6904, EE5731R","description":"The aim of this module is to provide a comprehensive introduction of various topics in computer vision, including: image formation, object recognition, image features, camera calibration, epipolar geometry, depth from stereo and video, Markov random fields, motion analysis, and some low-level vision. The module focuses on both the principles of these vision topics and their associated mathematical and computational tools. By the end of the course, students are expected to understand and to be able to implement some computer vision algorithms from the low level to high level.","title":"Visual Computing","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"[applicable to UG level students only] EE4212 and EE4704.
