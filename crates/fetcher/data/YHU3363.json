We also explore economic relationships and financial practices across the globe between 1000 and 1850, focusing on trade in drugs, slaves, and silver, as well as the development and practices of trading diasporas and corporations. The course concludes with the Great Divergence debate in economic history and asks what enabled Western Europe to achieve sustained economic growth between the 18th and 20th century while China and India lagged behind?","title":"Global History of Capitalism","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC2121 Modern Social Thought or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU3363","prereq_tree":"YCC2121","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
