Students will learn stability characteristics and design steel frames for local and global stability according to Eurocode 3 (EC3). The topics covered include general principles of stability, buckling of column, beamcolumn and frames. Students will also be taught how to deal with general stability problems of frames using computer applications and numerical formulation.\n\nThe module is targeted at post-graduate and senior under-graduate civil engineering students with a keen interest on stability analysis and design.","title":"Structural Stability Concepts & Applications","department":"Civil and Environmental Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Background in structural matrix analysis","module_credit":"2","module_code":"CE5516A","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,1,0,1,5]}
