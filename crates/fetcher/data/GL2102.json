{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This course introduces students to the study of international political economy, challenging a widely held misconception that global politics and international economics are separable. “Who gets what, how, and why?” – these are the fundamental questions we ask throughout this course. Students will develop an understanding of the major theoretical approaches and key substantive issues in the field of IPE, including the politics of trade, international monetary relations, and transnational corporations. This course also aims to incorporate an examination of newer theoretical development, such as colonial and feminist approaches to global political economy, as well as cutting-edge topics like environment.","title":"Global Political Economy","department":"Political Science","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"GL1101E","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GL2102","prereq_tree":"GL1101E","fulfill_requirements":["GL3101","GL2104"],"workload":[2,1,0,2,5]}
