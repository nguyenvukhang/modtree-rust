{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"ME3232 Compressible Flow","description":"This module introduces students to some of the physical phenomena in compressible flow. The theories in one- and two-dimensional flow will be described, explained and analysed in this module. Topics include subsonic and supersonic flow, convergingâ€“diverging nozzle, normal and oblique shock waves, Prandtl-Meyer flows, flow with friction and heat exchange, Fanno line, Rayleigh line, twodimensional compressible flows, thin airfoils in supersonic flow, method of characteristics, hypersonic and high temperature gas dynamics, and optical methods in compressible flow measurements. Real-life applications, such as sonic boom, gas turbine, ramjet and scramjet combustion, supersonic nozzle design, space shuttle reentry will be discussed.","title":"Compressible and High-Speed Flow","department":"Mechanical Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"ME2134 Fluid Mechanics I","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ME5306","prereq_tree":"ME2134","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,2,5]}
