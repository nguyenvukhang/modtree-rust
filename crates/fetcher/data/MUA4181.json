{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Professional Concepts in Orchestral Repertoire is the capstone seminar for advanced orchestral players intending to audition for professional ensembles. Building on the repertoire and audition-skills acquired in MUA3181, this module will emulate the experience of professional level orchestral auditions from both the auditionee and panel perspectives by combining instrumental groups for selected sessions. Practical application of appropriate repertoire and of current best practices for professional level orchestral auditions will be core components of this course. In preparation for the weekly sessions, students should also be involved in reflective practice in relation to developing a broader appreciation of orchestral traditions and hiring practices.","title":"Professional Concepts in Orchestral Repertoire","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"MUA3181","module_credit":"4","module_code":"MUA4181","prereq_tree":"MUA3181","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,0,0,2,4]}
