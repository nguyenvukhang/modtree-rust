{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GET1047","description":"From what sources do we engender our individual and group identities, and to what extent do the arts stimulate this process? This course begins with an introduction to identity theory, and then explores identity issues – such as male and female, self, national, racial, and social identities – with an emphasise on their manifestations in various performance, visual, and literary art forms. Students will analyse and evaluate their own identities in relation to the course materials and the arts in their lives, requiring critical self-reflection and self-assessment.","title":"Art and Identity","department":"YSTCM Dean's Office","faculty":"YST Conservatory of Music","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"GEX1027","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,0,0,4,4]}
