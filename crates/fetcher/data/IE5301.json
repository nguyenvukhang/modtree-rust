{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module will focus on the interaction dynamics between the human operator and the machine/system in a human-machine system. We shall begin by defining the areas of concern in human factors engineering (e.g. the human-machine interface, the displays to be perceived, and the controls to be actuated). We shall discuss also the tools and methodologies used by a human factors engineer. The latter portion of the subject will discuss issues of capabilities and limitations of the human operator.","title":"Human Factors In Engineering And Design","department":"Industrial Systems Engineering and Management","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"IE5301","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
