Students will learn how to get financial data and formulations out of spreadsheets, no matter how peculiar. Often, spreadsheets are used as a reporting tool, which they are not, and they create very elaborated and complicated financial models that are non-human readable. The aim for this module is to teach students different tidy data techniques to clean, structure, aggregate, and explore structured and unstructured data to drive insights and make better informed decisions.","title":"Sem in Analytics: Tidyverse Principles And Tidymodels","department":"Analytics and Operations","faculty":"NUS Business School","prerequisite":"DAO1704 Decision Analytics using Spreadsheets\nDAO2702 Programming for Business Analytics","module_credit":"4","module_code":"DBA4761A","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["DAO1704","DAO2702"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,3,4]}
