{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CS2030","description":"This module is a follow up to CS1010. It explores two modern programming paradigms, object-oriented programming and functional programming. Through a series of integrated assignments, students will learn to develop medium-scale software programs in the order of thousands of lines of code and tens of classes using object-oriented design principles and advanced programming constructs available in the two paradigms. Topics include objects and classes, composition, association, inheritance, interface, polymorphism, abstract classes, dynamic binding, lambda expression, effect-free programming, first class functions, closures, continuations, monad, etc.","title":"Programming Methodology II","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"CS1010 or its equivalent","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS2030S","prereq_tree":"CS1010","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,2,3,2]}
