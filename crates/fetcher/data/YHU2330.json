{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Animals, both real and imaginary, are ubiquitous in the art, literature, and material culture of medieval Europe, where they emerge as frequent objects of reflection on the nature of language, the ethics of violence, the organization of society, and the limits of what constitutes the human. This course will explore the medieval fascination with animals and the philosophical questions they raise. Drawing on the “animal turn” in contemporary cultural studies, we will investigate the complex and often ambiguous ways in which animals are represented in a range of genres, including bestiaries, fables, romance, and lyric.","title":"Real and Imagined Animals in Medieval Literature","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YCC1111 Literature and Humanities 1 and YCC1112 Literature and Humanities 2 or with the permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YHU2330","prereq_tree":{"and":["YCC1111","YCC1112"],"or":[]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
