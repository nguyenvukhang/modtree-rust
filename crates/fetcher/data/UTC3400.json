{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"GEM3902","description":"The Independent Study Module (ISM) provides an opportunity for senior undergraduates who are staying at the College of Alice & Peter Tan (CAPT) to do \nindependent critical reading or research work. Unlike a UROP, where the student contributes to an existing research project, an ISM is an individual study \nprogramme conceptualized by the student. ISMs undertaken at CAPT must be inter-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, or trans-disciplinary in topic and/or approach. \nStudent and supervisor need to submit for approval an ISM contract that gives a clear account of the topic, programme of study, evaluation, and other pertinent \ndetails. The ISM is a graded module.","title":"Independent Study","department":"College of Alice and Peter Tan","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTC3400","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,0,0,0,10]}
