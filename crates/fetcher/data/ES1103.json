It aims to equip students with the knowledge of the academic genre and the ability to apply such knowledge in academic communication. The module adopts a reading-into-writing approach using themed readings as springboard texts for students’ writing and provides opportunities for analysing and internalising ways of organising academic texts. Students will acquire essential academic skills required to cope with the rigour of academic writing at a tertiary level.","title":"English for Academic Purposes","department":"Center for Engl Lang Comms","faculty":"NUS","prerequisite":"1.
