{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Singapore’s manufacturing industry sector is an important part of Singapore’s economy contributing almost to about 20% of the Singapore’s GDP and employs almost a fifth of the Singapore’s workforce. It also accounts for almost 60% of the Singapore’s projected 2020 Greenhouse gas emissions. The lack of alternative clean energy sources such as renewables to a large extent being close to the equator, however, there is one fuel to which all the countries including Singapore have access to, a fuel that has everything needed for a sustainable and secure energy sector and that is Energy Efficiency. Energy Efficiency (EE) has been identified as a core strategy to reduce emissions. Demand-side management (DM) of energy represents an important opportunity for Singapore to further reduce the gas emissions while reducing the total energy cost and improving industrial competitiveness.","title":"Industrial Energy Efficiency","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"2","module_code":"EE5045","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[3,0,0,1,6]}
