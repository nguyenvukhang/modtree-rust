{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"CN4122 Process Synthesis and Simulation","description":"This module aims to provide fundamentals and methods of process synthesis and simulation, which are required for design of chemical processes/plants. Students learn a heuristic method for process development, simulation strategies, main steps in process design and rigorous process simulation using a commercial simulator through both lectures and many hands-on exercises. They will also learn detailed mechanical design of process equipment, cost estimation and profitability analysis of chemical processes. This module is only available to non-graduating students, by invitation from the Department.","title":"Process Synthesis and Simulation","department":"Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"Host department will access whether students meet pre-requisite on a case-by-case basis.","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CN4122N","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,2,0,4,2]}
