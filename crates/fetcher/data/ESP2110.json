{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"There are two design projects in this module.  First project covers control theory and its applications, open loop systems, closed loop systems, feedback control systems, Laplace transforms, PID controllers and the Root Locus Method. Students apply these lessons to a path follower robot kit. \nSecond project allows students to apply their understanding of Scanning Tunneling Microscopy to design and assemble a setup to maintain stable quantum tunneling. This involves Computer Assisted Design (CAD), digital fabrication of mechanical parts, integration and testing of a closed loop control analog circuit, and data logging and analysis via a PC-based Digital Acquisition (DAQ) system.","title":"Design Project","department":"Engineering Science Programme","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"ESP2110","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":["ESP3201"],"workload":[0,0,5,0,5]}
