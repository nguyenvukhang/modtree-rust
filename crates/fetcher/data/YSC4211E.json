{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This is an advanced seminar focussing on the critical reading and discussion of scientific papers in molecular biology, defined here as the study of the mechanisms by which genetic information is replicated, repaired, transcribed, and translated, the ways in which the expression of that information is regulated, and the evolutionary origins of these molecular strategies. The papers to be discussed will highlight key current problems in molecular biology as well as important experimental and conceptual approaches. The emphasis, though, is in developing skills in reading the primary literature, and in presenting and discussing scientific information effectively.","title":"Advanced Topics in Molecular Biology","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"YSC3257 Molecular Biology or YSC3233 Cell Biology (formerly known as Molecular Cell Biology) or with the permission of the instructor\n\nStudents who have not taken either Molecular Biology or Cell Biology, but have taken YSC2233 Genetics or YSC3241 Computational and Systems Biology may be able to enroll with permission of the instructor.","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSC4211E","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,9.5]}
