{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"This module will introduce principles and applications of novel and evolving imaging technologies relevant to biological applications. Elucidation of molecular and structural characteristics of living cells with a focus on Microbiology and Immunology will be addressed through different techniques such as correlative light-electron microscopy (CLEM), ultra-microscopy, Confocal Microscopy, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Holotomography (HT), Super Resolution Microscopy, Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), AFM- Infrared Radiation Spectroscopy (AFM-IR) and Focused ion beam/scanning electron microscope (FIB/SEM). This module will integrate didactic lectures, seminars and tutorials to introduce theory and applications of the above-mentioned techniques across disciplines of biology, bio-engineering and medicine.","title":"Bio-Imaging: Advanced Tools and Applications","department":"NUS Medicine Dean's Office","faculty":"Yong Loo Lin Sch of Medicine","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"2","module_code":"MDG5247","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[2,1,0,1,1]}
