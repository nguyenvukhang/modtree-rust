{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"MA1100 and CS1231 or its equivalent","description":"This module introduces mathematical tools required in the study of computer science. Topics include (1) Logic and proof techniques propositions, conditionals, quantifications. (2) Relations and Functions Equivalence relations and partitions. Partially ordered sets. Well-Ordering Principle. Function equality. Boolean/identity/inverse functions. Bijection. (3) Mathematical formulation of data models (linear model, trees, graphs). (4) Counting and Combinatoric Pigeonhole Principle. Inclusion-Exclusion Principle. Number of relations on a set, number of injections from one finite set to another, Diagonalization proof An infinite countable set has an uncountable power set; Algorithmic proof An infinite set has a countably infinite subset. Subsets of countable sets are countable.","title":"Discrete Structures","department":"Computer Science","faculty":"Computing","prerequisite":"A-level Mathematics or H2 Mathematics or MA1301 or MA1301FC or MA1301X","module_credit":"4","module_code":"CS1231S","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["MA1301","MA1301FC","MA1301X"]},"fulfill_requirements":["CS5469","CS4269","CS2109S","MA2202","MA2202S","MA2214","MA2219","MA3205","MA3219"],"workload":[3,1,0,3,3]}
