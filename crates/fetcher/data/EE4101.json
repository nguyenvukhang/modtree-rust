{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Radio and microwave systems are used for information transmission.  This module therefore introduces the student to a broad range of enabling knowledge and skills commonly employed by RF and microwave engineers to specify, analyse and design radio and microwave transmission systems.  Topics covered:  Time-varying EM fields: guided waves, evanescent modes and plane-wave propagation. Radiation: radiation mechanism, magnetic vector potential, current distribution on a thin wire, Hertzian dipole, Half-wave dipole & monopole. RF Antennas: parameters, aperture antennas and arrays.  RF Amplification: stability, gain and small-signal narrowband design.  RF Generation:  conditions for oscillation, oscillator design and dielectric resonators.   RF Receivers:  receiver and mixer parameters.  RF Systems: system gain and noise figure, satellite and terrestrial systems.","title":"RF Communications","department":"Electrical and Computer Engineering","faculty":"College of Design and Engineering","prerequisite":"PC2020","module_credit":"4","module_code":"EE4101","prereq_tree":"PC2020","fulfill_requirements":["EE5303","EE5801"],"workload":[2.5,0.5,0.5,2.0,4.5]}
