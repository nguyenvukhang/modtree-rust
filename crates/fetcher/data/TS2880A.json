{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"Asian theatre makers of the twentieth century have greatly contributed to the conception and formation of modernity in Asia. This module highlights three key historical moments in Asia’s modernizing process: Asia’s initial contacts with Europe and America at the turn of the century; the postwar era between the 1960s and the 1980s when political activism was at its height; and the more recent global and local theatre collaborations in the region. We will study theatre history, play texts, and digital recordings of performances to trace the development of modern Asia from the perspectives of theatre makers.","title":"Makers of Modern Theatre in Asia","department":"English,Ling.andTheatre Studies","faculty":"Arts and Social Science","prerequisite":"TS1101E or GEM1003","module_credit":"4","module_code":"TS2880A","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["TS1101E","GEM1003"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,3,4]}
