{"acad_year":"2022/2023","preclusion":"","description":"What is ‘Africa’ and who is African? Is the African continent a unified space or an ideological project? This seminar introduces students to key debates and intellectual trajectories within African Studies that contributed to the “invention” of Africa. We will look at how knowledge production on Africa shaped categories of gender, race, ethnicity, and religion, and how these categories were central to the colonial project. We will also trace “colonial afterlives” that persist through development projects, humanitarian discourses, and the circulation of global capital.","title":"What is the Global South Africa in the World","department":"Yale-NUS College","faculty":"Yale-NUS College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"5","module_code":"YSS2252","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0.0,0.0,0.0,6.5,6.0]}
