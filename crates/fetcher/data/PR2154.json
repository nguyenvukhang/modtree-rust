The drugâ€™s physicochemical properties underpin the formulation of inhalation delivery system. Pharmacology and applied therapeutics inform students on clinical decision making and care plan development. The strong association of smoking to lung cancer, supported by case-control study, is used to illustrate how Trans Theoretical Model for behaviour change adopted in smoking cessation programme can instil health advocacy attitude in students. The classification of medical devices and therapeutic products is used to introduce principles of regulatory science.","title":"Respiratory System: Science & Therapeutics","department":"Pharmacy","faculty":"Science","prerequisite":"PR1152 Pharmacy Foundations: Science & Therapeutics I\nPR1153 Pharmacy Foundations: Science & Therapeutics II\nPR2156 Integumentary & Ocular Systems: Science & Therapeutics","module_credit":"6","module_code":"PR2154","prereq_tree":{"and":[],"or":["PR1152","PR1153","PR2156"]},"fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[4,3,3,1,4]}
