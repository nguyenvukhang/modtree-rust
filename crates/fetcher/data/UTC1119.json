This course gives students the opportunity to consider the nature of crime and punishment from a number of perspectives in philosophy, criminology and fiction. They will examine the justifications for deeming behaviour criminal, the causes of this behaviour, as well as the divergent legal responses to it across time and cultures and with changes in technology. Through the use of case studies, students will test their\nintuitions about when the imposition of punishment is morally acceptable.","title":"Junior Seminar: Crime and Punishment","department":"Tembusu College","faculty":"Residential College","prerequisite":"","module_credit":"4","module_code":"UTC1119","prereq_tree":"","fulfill_requirements":[],"workload":[0,3,0,0,7]}
